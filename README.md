Here's a quick code sample. Again, see the [MongoDB Ruby Tutorial](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/wiki/Tutorial) for much more:

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'mongo'

include Mongo

@client = MongoClient.new('localhost', 27017)
@db     = @client['sample-db']
@coll   = @db['test']

@coll.remove

3.times do |i|
  @coll.insert({ 'a' => i+1 })
end

puts "There are #{@coll.count} records. Here they are:"
@coll.find.each { |doc| puts doc.inspect }
```

# Installation

### Ruby Versions

The driver is stable and is consistently tested on Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.3, and 2.0.0 as well as JRuby 1.7.x.

Note that if you're on 1.8.7, be sure that you're using a patchlevel >= 249. There are some IO bugs in earlier versions.

### Gems

```sh
$ gem update --system
$ gem install mongo
```

For a significant performance boost, you'll want to install the C extension:

```sh
$ gem install bson_ext
```

Note that bson_ext isn't used with JRuby. Instead, we use some native Java extensions are bundled with the bson gem. If you ever need to modify these extensions, you can recompile with the following rake task:

```sh
$ rake compile:jbson
```

### From the GitHub source

The source code is available at http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver.
You can either clone the git repository or download a tarball or zip file.
Once you have the source, you can use it from wherever you downloaded it or
you can install it as a gem from the source by typing:

```sh
$ rake install
```

# Examples

For extensive examples, see the [MongoDB Ruby Tutorial](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/wiki/Tutorial).

# GridFS

The Ruby driver includes two abstractions for storing large files: Grid and GridFileSystem.

The Grid class is a Ruby implementation of MongoDB's GridFS file storage
specification. GridFileSystem is essentially the same, but provides a more filesystem-like API and assumes that filenames are unique.

An instance of either class represents an individual file store. See the API reference for details.

Examples:

```ruby
# Write a file on disk to the Grid
file = File.open('image.jpg')
grid = Mongo::Grid.new(db)
id   = grid.put(file)

# Retrieve the file
file = grid.get(id)
file.read

# Get all the file's metadata
file.filename
file.content_type
file.metadata
```

# Notes

## Thread Safety

The driver is thread-safe in Ruby MRI/YARV and JRuby.

## Connection Pooling

The driver implements connection pooling. By default, only one
socket connection will be opened to MongoDB. However, if you're running a
multi-threaded application, you can specify a maximum pool size and a maximum
timeout for waiting for old connections to be released to the pool.

To set up a pooled connection to a single MongoDB instance:

```ruby
@client = MongoClient.new("localhost", 27017, :pool_size => 5, :pool_timeout => 5)
```

Though the pooling architecture will undoubtedly evolve, it currently owes much credit
to the connection pooling implementations in ActiveRecord and PyMongo.

## Forking

Certain Ruby application servers work by forking, and it has long been necessary to
re-establish the child process's connection to the database after fork. But with the release
of v1.3.0, the Ruby driver detects forking and reconnects automatically.

## Environment variable `MONGODB_URI`

`Mongo::MongoClient.from_uri`, `Mongo::MongoClient.new` and `Mongo::MongoReplicaSetClient.new` will use <code>ENV["MONGODB_URI"]</code> if no other args are provided.

The URI must fit this specification:

    mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]

If the type of connection (direct or replica set) should be determined entirely from <code>ENV["MONGODB_URI"]</code>, you may want to use `Mongo::MongoClient.from_uri` because it will return either `Mongo::MongoClient` or a `Mongo::MongoReplicaSetClient` depending on how many hosts are specified. Trying to use `Mongo::MongoClient.new` with multiple hosts in <code>ENV["MONGODB_URI"]</code> will raise an exception.

## String Encoding

The BSON ("Binary JSON") format used to communicate with Mongo requires that
strings be UTF-8 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).

Ruby 1.9 has built-in character encoding support. All strings sent to Mongo
and received from Mongo are converted to UTF-8 when necessary, and strings
read from Mongo will have their character encodings set to UTF-8.

When used with Ruby 1.8, the bytes in each string are written to and read from
Mongo as is. If the string is ASCII, all is well, because ASCII is a subset of
UTF-8. If the string is not ASCII, it may not be a well-formed UTF-8
string.

## Primary Keys

The `_id` field is a primary key. It is treated specially by the database, and
its use makes many operations more efficient. The value of an _id may be of
any type. The database itself inserts an _id value if none is specified when
a record is inserted.

### Primary Key Factories

A primary key factory is a class you supply to a DB object that knows how to
generate _id values. If you want to control _id values or even their types,
using a PK factory lets you do so.

You can tell the Ruby MongoDB driver how to create primary keys by passing in
the :pk option to the MongoClient#db method.

```ruby
include Mongo
db = MongoClient.new('localhost', 27017).db('dbname', :pk => MyPKFactory.new)
```

A primary key factory object must respond to :create_pk, which should
take a hash and return a hash which merges the original hash with any
primary key fields the factory wishes to inject.

NOTE: if the object already has a primary key, the factory should not
inject a new key; this means that the object may already exist in the
database.  The idea here is that whenever a record is inserted, the
:pk object's +create_pk+ method will be called and the new hash
returned will be inserted.

Here is a sample primary key factory, taken from the tests:

```ruby
class TestPKFactory
  def create_pk(doc)
    doc['_id'] ||= BSON::ObjectId.new
    doc
  end
end
```

Here's a slightly more sophisticated one that handles both symbol and string
keys. This is the PKFactory that comes with the MongoRecord code (an
ActiveRecord-like framework for non-Rails apps) and the AR Mongo adapter code
(for Rails):

```ruby
class PKFactory
  def create_pk(doc)
    return doc if doc[:_id]
    doc.delete(:_id)      # in case it exists but the value is nil
    doc['_id'] ||= BSON::ObjectId.new
    doc
  end
end
```

A database's PK factory object may be set either when a DB object is created
or immediately after you obtain it, but only once. The only reason it is
changeable at all is so that libraries such as MongoRecord that use this
driver can set the PK factory after obtaining the database but before using it
for the first time.

## The DB Class

### Strict mode

_**NOTE:** Support for strict mode has been deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0 of the driver._

Each database has an optional strict mode. If strict mode is on, then asking
for a collection that does not exist will raise an error, as will asking to
create a collection that already exists. Note that both these operations are
completely harmless; strict mode is a programmer convenience only.

To turn on strict mode, either pass in :strict => true when obtaining a DB
object or call the `:strict=` method:

```ruby
db = MongoClient.new('localhost', 27017).db('dbname', :strict => true)
# I'm feeling lax
db.strict = false
# No, I'm not!
db.strict = true
```

The method DB#strict? returns the current value of that flag.

## Cursors

Notes:

* Cursors are enumerable (and have a #to_a method).

* The query isn't sent to the server until you actually attempt to retrieve data from a
  cursor.

* Cursors will timeout on the server after 10 minutes. If you need to keep a cursor
  open for more than 10 minutes, specify `:timeout => false` when you create the cursor.

## Socket timeouts

The Ruby driver supports timeouts on socket read operations. To enable them, set the
`:op_timeout` option when you create a `Mongo::MongoClient` object.

If implementing higher-level timeouts, using tools like `Rack::Timeout`, it's very important
to call `Mongo::MongoClient#close` to prevent the subsequent operation from receiving the previous
request.

# Testing

Before running the tests, make sure you install all test dependencies by running:

```sh
$ gem install bundler; bundle install
```

To run all default test suites (without the BSON extensions) just type:

```sh
$ rake test
```

If you want to run the default test suite using the BSON extensions:

```sh
$ rake test:ext
```

These will run both unit and functional tests. To run these tests alone:

```sh
$ rake test:unit
$ rake test:functional
```

To run any individual rake tasks with the BSON extension disabled, just pass BSON_EXT_DISABLED=true to the task:

```sh
$ rake test:unit BSON_EXT_DISABLED=true
```

If you want to test replica sets, you can run the following task:

```sh
$ rake test:replica_set
```

To run a single test at the top level, add -Itest since we no longer modify LOAD_PATH:

```sh
$ ruby -Itest -Ilib test/bson/bson_test.rb
```

To run a single test from the test directory, add -I. since we no longer modify LOAD_PATH:

```sh
$ ruby -I. -I../lib bson/bson_test.rb
```

To run a single test from its subdirectory, add -I.. since we no longer modify LOAD_PATH:

```sh
$ ruby -I.. -I../../lib bson_test.rb
```

To fix the following error on Mac OS X - "/.../lib/bson_ext/cbson.bundle: [BUG] Segmentation fault":

```sh
$ rake compile
```
