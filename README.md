-----
The officially supported Ruby driver for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org).

> **Note: You are viewing the 2.x version of the MongoDB Ruby driver which is currently unreleased and under heavy development. To view the current stable version of driver, please use the [1.x-stable](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/tree/1.x-stable) branch.**


Installation
-----

**Gem Installation**<br>
The Ruby driver is released and distributed through RubyGems and it can be installed with the following command:
```bash
gem install mongo
```
**Github Installation**<br>
For development and test environments (not recommended for production) you can also install the Ruby driver directly from source:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver.git
cd mongo-ruby-driver

# checkout a specific version by tag (optional)
git checkout 2.x.x

# install all development dependencies
gem install bundler
bundle install

# install the ruby driver
rake install
```

Usage
-----
Here is a quick example of basic usage for the Ruby driver:
```ruby
require 'mongo'

# connecting to the database
client = Mongo::MongoClient.new # defaults to localhost:27017
db     = client['example-db']
coll   = db['example-collection']

# inserting documents
10.times { |i| coll.insert({ :count => i+1 }) }

# finding documents
puts "There are #{coll.count} total documents. Here they are:"
coll.find.each { |doc| puts doc.inspect }

# updating documents
coll.update({ :count => 5 }, { :count => 'foobar' })

# removing documents
coll.remove({ :count => 8 })
coll.remove
```
