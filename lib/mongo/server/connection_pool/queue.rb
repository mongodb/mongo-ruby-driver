    class ConnectionPool

      # A LIFO queue of connections to be used by the connection pool. This is
      # based on mperham's connection pool.
      #
      # @note The queue contains active connections that are available for
      #   use. It does not track connections which are in use (checked out).
      #   It is easy to confuse the size of the connection pool (number of
      #   connections that are used plus number of connections that are
      #   available for use) and the size of the queue (number of connections
      #   that have already been created that are available for use).
      #   API documentation for this class states whether each size refers
      #   to the pool or to the queue size. Note that minimum and maximum
      #   sizes only make sense when talking about the connection pool,
      #   as the size of the queue of available connections is determined by
      #   the size constraints of the pool plus how many connections are
      #   currently checked out.
