    # @note Cluster should never be directly instantiated outside of a Client.

    # @note When connecting to a mongodb+srv:// URI, the client expands such a
    #   URI into a list of servers and passes that list to the Cluster
    #   constructor. When connecting to a standalone mongod, the Cluster
    #   constructor receives the corresponding address as an array of one string.
    #
    # @param [ Array<String> ] seeds The addresses of the configured servers
    # @param [ Monitoring ] monitoring The monitoring.
    # @param [ Hash ] options Options. Client constructor forwards its
    #   options to Cluster constructor, although Cluster recognizes
    #   only a subset of the options recognized by Client.
    #
    # @option options [ true | false ] :direct_connection Whether to connect
    #   directly to the specified seed, bypassing topology discovery. Exactly
    #   one seed must be provided.
    # @option options [ Symbol ] :connect Deprecated - use :direct_connection
    #   option instead of this option. The connection method to use. This
    #   forces the cluster to behave in the specified way instead of
    #   auto-discovering. One of :direct, :replica_set, :sharded
    # @option options [ Symbol ] :replica_set The name of the replica set to
    #   connect to. Servers not in this replica set will be ignored.
    # @option options [ true | false ] :scan Whether to scan all seeds
    #   in constructor. The default in driver version 2.x is to do so;
    #   driver version 3.x will not scan seeds in constructor. Opt in to the
    #   new behavior by setting this option to false. *Note:* setting
    #   this option to nil enables scanning seeds in constructor in driver
    #   version 2.x. Driver version 3.x will recognize this option but
    #   will ignore it and will never scan seeds in the constructor.
    # @option options [ true | false ] :monitoring_io For internal driver
    #   use only. Set to false to prevent SDAM-related I/O from being
    #   done by this cluster or servers under it. Note: setting this option
    #   to false will make the cluster non-functional. It is intended for
    #   use in tests which manually invoke SDAM state transitions.
    # @option options [ true | false ] :cleanup For internal driver use only.
    #   Set to false to prevent endSessions command being sent to the server
    #   to clean up server sessions when the cluster is disconnected, and to
    #   to not start the periodic executor. If :monitoring_io is false,
    #   :cleanup automatically defaults to false as well.
    # @option options [ Float ] :heartbeat_frequency The interval, in seconds,
    #   for the server monitor to refresh its description via ismaster.
