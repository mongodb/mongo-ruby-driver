module Mongo

  # Representation of a query and options producing a result set of documents.
  #
  # A +Scope+ can be modified using helpers.  Helpers can be chained, as each
  # one returns a +Scope+ if arguments are provided.
  #
  # The query message is sent to the server when a "terminator" is called.
  # For example, when #each is called on a +Scope+, a Cursor object is created,
  # which then sends the query to the server.
  #
  # A +Scope+ is not created directly by a user. Rather, +Collection+ creates a
  # +Scope+ when a CRUD operation is called and returns it to the user to
  # interact with.
  #
  # @note The +Scope+ API is semipublic.
