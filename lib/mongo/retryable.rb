module Mongo

  # Defines basic behavior around retrying operations.

  module Retryable

    # Execute a read operation returning a cursor with retrying.
    #
    # This method performs server selection for the specified server selector
    # and yields to the provided block, which should execute the initial
    # query operation and return its result. The block will be passed the
    # server selected for the operation. If the block raises an exception,
    # and this exception corresponds to a read retryable error, and read
    # retries are enabled for the client, this method will perform server
    # selection again and yield to the block again (with potentially a
    # different server). If the block returns successfully, the result
    # of the block (which should be a Mongo::Operation::Result) is used to
    # construct a Mongo::Cursor object for the result set. The cursor
    # is then returned.
    #
    # If modern retry reads are on (which is the default), the initial read
    # operation will be retried once. If legacy retry reads are on, the
    # initial read operation will be retried zero or more times depending
    # on the :max_read_retries client setting, the default for which is 1.
    # To disable read retries, turn off modern read retries by setting
    # retry_reads: false and set :max_read_retries to 0 on the client.
