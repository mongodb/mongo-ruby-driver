module Mongo
  class Error

    # Raised when the driver is used incorrectly.
    #
    # Normally the driver passes certain data to the server and lets the
    # server return an error if the data is invalid. This makes it possible
    # for the server to add functionality in the future and for older
    # driver versions to support such functionality transparently, but
    # also complicates debugging.
    #
    # Setting the environment variable MONGO_RUBY_DRIVER_LINT to 1, true
    # or yes will make the driver perform additional checks on data it passes
    # to the server, to flag failures sooner. This exception is raised on
    # such failures.
    #
    # @since 2.6.1
