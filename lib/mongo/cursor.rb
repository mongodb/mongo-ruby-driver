  # Client-side representation of an iterator over a query result set on

  # +Cursor+ objects are not directly exposed to application code. Rather,
  # +Collection::View+ exposes the +Enumerable+ interface to the applications,
  # and the enumerator is backed by a +Cursor+ instance.
  #
  # @example Get an array of 5 users named Emily.
  #   users.find({:name => 'Emily'}).limit(5).to_a
  #
  # @example Call a block on each user doc.
  #   users.find.each { |doc| puts doc }
