      # Retrieves AWS credentials from a variety of sources.
      #
      # This class provides for AWS credentials retrieval from:
      # - the passed user (which receives the credentials passed to the
      #   client via URI options and Ruby options)
      # - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
      #   environment variables (commonly used by AWS SDKs and various tools,
      #   as well as AWS Lambda)
      # - EC2 metadata endpoint
      # - ECS metadata endpoint
      #
      # The sources listed above are consulted in the order specified.
      # The first source that contains any of the three credential components
      # (access key id, secret access key or session token) is used.
      # The credential components must form a valid set if any of the components
      # is specified; meaning, access key id and secret access key must
      # always be provided together, and if a session token is provided
      # the key id and secret key must also be provided. If a source provides
      # partial credentials, credential retrieval fails with an exception.
