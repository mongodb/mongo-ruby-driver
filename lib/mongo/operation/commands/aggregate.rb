      # A MongoDB aggregate operation.
      #
      # @note An aggregate operation can behave like a read and return a 
      #   result set, or can behave like a write operation and
      #   output results to a user-specified collection.
      #
      # @example Create the aggregate operation.
      #   Aggregate.new({
      #     :selector => {
      #       :aggregate => 'test_coll', :pipeline => [{ '$out' => 'test-out' }]
      #     },
      #     :db_name => 'test_db'
      #   })
      #
      # Initialization:
      #   param [ Hash ] spec The specifications for the operation.
      #
      #   option spec :selector [ Hash ] The aggregate selector.
      #   option spec :db_name [ String ] The name of the database on which
      #     the operation should be executed.
      #   option spec :options [ Hash ] Options for the aggregate command.
      #
      # @since 2.0.0
