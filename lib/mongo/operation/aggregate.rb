    # A MongoDB aggregate operation.

    # @note An aggregate operation can behave like a read and return a 
    #   result set, or can behave like a write operation and
    #   output results to a user-specified collection.
    #
    # @example Create the aggregate operation.
    #   Aggregate.new({
    #     :selector => {
    #       :aggregate => 'test_coll', :pipeline => [{ '$out' => 'test-out' }]
    #     },
    #     :db_name => 'test_db'
    #   })
    #
    # @param [ Hash ] spec The specifications for the operation.
    #
    # @option spec :selector [ Hash ] The aggregate selector.
    # @option spec :db_name [ String ] The name of the database on which
    #   the operation should be executed.
    # @option spec :options [ Hash ] Options for the aggregate command.
    #
    # @since 2.0.0
