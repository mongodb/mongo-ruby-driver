      # Provides behaviour around a `$changeStream` pipeline stage in the
      # aggregation framework. Specifying this stage allows users to request
      # that notifications are sent for all changes to a particular collection
      # or database.
      #
      # @note Only available in server versions 3.6 and higher.
      # @note ChangeStreams do not work properly with JRuby because of the
      #  issue documented here: https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/4212.
      #  Namely, JRuby eagerly evaluates #next on an Enumerator in a background
      #  green thread, therefore calling #next on the change stream will cause
      #  getMores to be called in a loop in the background.
