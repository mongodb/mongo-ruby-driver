    # A +View+ can be modified using helpers. Helpers can be chained,
    # as each one returns a +View+ if arguments are provided.

    # The query message is sent to the server when a "terminator" is called.
    # For example, when #each is called on a +View+, a Cursor object is
    # created, which then sends the query to the server.

    # A +View+ is not created directly by a user. Rather, +View+
    # creates a +View+ when a CRUD operation is called and returns it to
    # the user to interact with.
