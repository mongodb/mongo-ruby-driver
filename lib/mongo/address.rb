    # If the address stored in this object looks like a Unix path, this method
    # returns a Unix domain socket for this path.

    # this object to IPv4 and IPv6 addresses using +Socket#getaddrinfo+, then
    # connects to the resulting addresses and returns the socket of the first
    # successful connection. The order in which address families (IPv4/IPV6)
    # are tried is the same order in which the addresses are returned by
    # +getaddrinfo+, and is determined by the host system.
    #
    # Name resolution is performed on each +socket+ call. This is done so that
    # any changes to which addresses the host names used as seeds or in
    # server configuration resolve to are immediately noticed by the driver,
    # even if a socket has been connected to the affected host name/address
    # before. However, note that DNS TTL values may still affect when a change
    # to a host address is noticed by the driver.
    #
    # This method propagates any exceptions raised during DNS resolution and
    # subsequent connection attempts. In case of a host name resolving to
    # multiple IP addresses, the error raised by the last attempt is propagated
    # to the caller. This method does not map exceptions to Mongo::Error
    # subclasses, and may raise any subclass of Exception.
