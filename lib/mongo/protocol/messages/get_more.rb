    # MongoDB Wire protocol GetMore message.
    #
    # This is a client request message that is sent to the server in order
    # to retrieve additional documents from a cursor that has already been
    # instantiated.
    #
    # The operation requires that you specify the database and collection
    # name as well as the cursor id because cursors are scoped to a namespace.

      #
      # @param database [String, Symbol] The database to query.
      # @param collection [String, Symbol] The collection to query.
      # @param number_to_return [Integer] The number of documents to return.
      # @param cursor_id [Integer] The cursor id returned in a reply.
