This tutorial discusses using the core MongoDB Ruby driver, version 2.0

.. seealso::  `Ruby Driver Source Code on GitHub <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver>`_


Installation
------------

The Ruby driver is bundled as a gem and is hosted on `Rubygems
<https://rubygems.org/gems/mongo>`_. The driver can be installed
manually or with bundler.

To install the gem manually:

.. code-block:: sh

    gem install mongo

To install the gem with bundler, include the following in your Gemfile:

.. code-block:: ruby

    gem 'mongo', '~> 2.0'

Note the following compatibility matrix to determine if the driver is
supported on your Runtime and server.

Creating a Client
-----------------

The entry point to using the driver in all applications is via a ``Mongo::Client``.
A client can be created by passing in a list of hosts and options, or alternatively
can be instantiated using a URI. If a database name is not provided, then the
``admin`` database will be used by default.

To create a client to a standalone server, provide one host in the seed list.
Optionally you can force the cluster topology to be standalone without going through
the auto-discovery steps.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'mydb')
  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'mydb', :connect => :direct)
  Mongo::Client.new('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mydb')

To create a client to a replica set, pass one or more hosts and the replica set name.
The client has an auto-discovery feature that will find all members of the replica
set if not all are provided.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017', '127.0.0.1:27018' ], :database => 'mydb', :replica_set => 'myapp')
  Mongo::Client.new('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017,127.0.0.1:27018/mydb?replicaSet=myapp')

To create a client to a sharded cluster, pass one or more mongos hosts. The auto-
discovery functionality will determine that the servers are mongoses, but if you
would like to force it and bypass the auto-discovery pass the sharded option to the
client.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'mydb')
  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'mydb', :connect => :sharded)
  Mongo::Client.new('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mydb?connect=sharded' ])

Client Options
``````````````

A number of different options can be passed to a ``Mongo::Client`` to configure driver
behaviour, either by providing them in the options hash to the constructor or by
providing them in the URI.

Since the URI options are required in camel case, which is not the Ruby standard, the
following table shows the option in the URI and its corresponding option if passed
to the constructor in Ruby. Note that the options passed directly should be symbols.

The options are explained in detail `here <http://docs.mongodb.org/master/reference/connection-string/>`_.
Note that options that are set in **milliseconds** in the URI, are represented as a ``Float``
in Ruby and the units are **seconds**.

Inserting
---------

Inserting documents into a collection via the driver is done by selecting a
collection on the client and calling ``insert_one`` or ``insert_many``.

Insert operations will return a ``Mongo::Operation::Result`` object which will
give you information about the insert itself.

On MongoDB 2.6 and higher, if the insert failed, then an exception will be
raised since write commands are used.

On MongoDB 2.4, an exception will only be raised if the insert failed and the
write concern is 1 or higher.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')

  result = client[:artists].insert_one({ name: 'FKA Twigs' })
  result.inserted_count # returns 1, because 1 document was inserted.

  result = client[:artists].insert_many([
    { :name => 'Flying Lotus' },
    { :name => 'Aphex Twin' }
  ])
  result.inserted_count # returns 2, since 2 documents were inserted.

Querying
--------

The Ruby driver provides a fluent interface for querying that is accessed
via the method ``find`` on the collection. From there, one has various
options that can be added.

The query is lazily executed against the server only when iterating the
results - at that point the query is dispatched and a ``Mongo::Cursor`` is
returned.

To find all documents for a given filter, simply call ``find`` with the
query:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')

  client[:artists].find(:name => 'Flying Lotus').each do |document|
    #=> Yields a BSON::Document.
  end

Query Options
`````````````

To add options to a query, simply chain the appropriate methods after the
``find``. Note that the underlying object, the ``Mongo::Collection::View``,
is immutable and a new object will be returned after each method call.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')

  documents = client[:artists].find(:name => 'Flying Lotus').skip(10).limit(10)
  documents.each do |document|
    #=> Yields a BSON::Document.
  end

The following is a full list of the available options that can be added
when querying and their corresponding methods as examples.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 80

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - ``#allow_partial_results``
     - For use with sharded clusters. If a shard is down, allows the query
       to return results from the shards that are up, potentially only getting
       a portion of the results.
   * - ``#batch_size(integer)``
     - Specifies the size of each batch of documents the cursor will return on
       each GETMORE operation.
   * - ``#comment(string)``
     - Adds a comment to the query.
   * - ``#hint(hash)``
     - Provides the query with an index hint to use.
   * - ``#limit(integer)``
     - Limits the number of returned documents to the provided value.
   * - ``#max_scan(integer)``
     - Sets the maximum number of documents to scan if a full collection scan
       would be performed.
   * - ``#no_cursor_timeout``
     - MongoDB automatically closes inactive cursors after a period of 10
       minutes. Call this for cursors to remain open indefinitely on the server.
   * - ``#projection(hash)``
     - Specifies the fields to include or exclude from the results.

       .. code-block:: ruby

         client[:artists].find.projection(:name => 1)

   * - ``#read(hash)``
     - Changes the read preference for this query only.

       .. code-block:: ruby

         client[:artists].find.read(:mode => :secondary_preferred)

   * - ``#show_disk_loc(boolean)``
     - Tells the results to also include the location of the documents on disk.
   * - ``#skip(integer)``
     - Skip the provided number of documents in the results.
   * - ``#snapshot``
     - Execute the query in snapshot mode.
   * - ``#sort(hash)``
     - Specifies sort criteria for the query.

       .. code-block:: ruby

         client[:artists].find.sort(:name => -1)

Additional Query Operations
```````````````````````````

To execute a count of documents on a collection, call ``count`` on the view.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')

  client[:artists].find(:name => 'Flying Lotus').count

To get an array of distinct field values, use ``distinct``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')

  client[:artists].find.distinct(:name)

Updating
--------

Updating documents comes in 2 variations, either by executing a single or
multiple update, or by leveraging the ``$findAndModify`` command.

To update documents via the regular mode, which returns a ``Result`` object,
use ``update_one``, ``update_many``, or ``replace_one``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  artists = client[:artists]

  result = artists.find(:name => 'Goldie').update_one("$inc" => { :plays => 1 })
  result.modified_count # Returns 1.

  result = artists.find(:label => 'Hospital').update_many("$inc" => { :plays => 1 })
  result.modified_count # Returns the number of documents that were updated.

  result = artists.find(:name => 'Aphex Twin').replace_one(:name => 'Richard James')
  result.modified_count # Returns 1.

To update documents and return a document via ``$findAndModify``, use one of
the three provided helpers: ``find_one_and_delete``, ``find_one_and_replace``,
or ``find_one_and_update``. One may opt to return the document before or after
the modification occurs.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  artists = client[:artists]

  artists.find(:name => 'José James').find_one_and_delete # Returns the document.

  doc = artists.find(:name => 'José James').find_one_and_replace(:name => 'José')
  doc # Return the document before the update.

  doc = artists.find(:name => 'José James').
    find_one_and_replace({ :name => 'José' }, :return_document => :after)
  doc # Return the document after the update.

  doc = artists.find(:name => 'José James').
    find_one_and_update('$set' => { :name => 'José' })
  doc # Return the document before the update.

  doc = artists.find(:name => 'José James').
    find_one_and_replace({ '$set' => { :name => 'José' }}, :return_document => :after)
  doc # Return the document after the update.

Removing
--------

Removing documents from a collection is done either in single or multiples.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  artists = client[:artists]

  result = artists.find(:name => 'Björk').delete_one
  result.deleted_count # Returns 1.

  result = artists.find(:label => 'Mute').delete_many
  result.deleted_count # Returns the number deleted.

Collections
-----------

The driver provides some helpers to deal with administrative type tasks with
collections.

To create a collection with options (such as creating a capped collection),
pass the options when getting the collection from the client and call
``create``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  artists = client[:artists, :capped => true, :size => 1024]
  artists.create
  artists.capped? # Returns true.

To drop a collection, call ``drop`` on the collection object.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  artists = client[:artists]
  artists.drop

Databases
---------

The driver provides various helpers on database objects for executing
commands, getting collection lists, and administrative tasks.

To get a list of collections or collection names for a database, use
``collections`` and ``collection_names``, respectively.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  database = client.database

  database.collections # Returns an array of Collection objects.
  database.collection_names # Returns an array of collection names as strings.

To execute any command on the database, execute ``command``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  database = client.database

  result = database.command(:ismaster => 1)
  result.first # Returns the BSON::Document returned from the server.

To drop a database, execute the ``drop`` method.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  client.database.drop


Indexing
--------

The driver provides the ability to create, drop and view indexes in a collection
via a special view on the collection.


Creating Indexes
````````````````

Indexes can be created one at a time, or multiples can be created in a single
operation. When creating multiples on MongoDB 3.0.0 and higher, the indexes
will be created in parallel, otherwise they will be created in order.

To create a single index, use ``create_one`` on the view.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  client[:bands].indexes.create_one({ :name => 1 }, :unique => true)

To create multiple indexes, use ``create_many``. Note that when creating many,
the index keys must be passed as a ``key`` value in the provided spec. This is
due to the fact that options can be different for each index being created.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  client[:bands].indexes.create_many([
    { :key => { name: 1 }, :unique => true },
    { :key => { label: -1 }}
  ])

The following is a full list of the available options that can be added
when creating indexes.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 80

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - ``:background``
     - Either ``true`` or ``false``. Tells the index to be created in the background.
   * - ``:expire_after``
     - Number of seconds to expire documents in the collection after.
   * - ``:name``
     - The name of the index.
   * - ``:sparse``
     - Whether the index should be sparse or not, either ``true`` or ``false``.
   * - ``:storage_engine``
     - The name of the storage engine for this particular index.
   * - ``:version``
     - The index format version to use.
   * - ``:default_language``
     - The default language of text indexes.
   * - ``:language_override``
     - The field name to use when overriding the default language.
   * - ``:text_version``
     - The version format for text index storage.
   * - ``:weights``
     - A document specifying fields and weights in text search.
   * - ``:sphere_version``
     - The 2d sphere index version.
   * - ``:bits``
     - Sets the maximum boundary for latitude and longitude in the 2d index.
   * - ``:max``
     - Maximum boundary for latitude and longitude in the 2d index.
   * - ``:min``
     - Minimum boundary for latitude and longitude in the 2d index.
   * - ``:bucket_size``
     - The number of units within which to group the location values in a geo haystack index.


Dropping Indexes
````````````````

To drop an index, call ``dropOne`` or ``dropAll``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')

  client[:bands].indexes.drop_one('name_1') # Drops the name_1 index.
  client[:bands].indexes.drop_all # Drops all indexes in the collection.


Listing Indexes
```````````````

To view all the indexes in a collection, iterate over the index view.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')

  client[:bands].indexes.each do |index|
    p index
  end


Authentication
--------------

MongoDB supports a variety of `authentication mechanisms <http://docs.mongodb.org/master/core/access-control/>`_.

For more information about configuring your MongoDB server for each of these authentication mechanisms please see MongoDB's `online documentation <http://docs.mongodb.org/master/tutorial/enable-authentication>`_.

Creating a user
```````````````

A user can be created in a database by calling ``create`` on the users view with the name, password, and roles (optional).

.. code-block:: ruby

  client.database.users.create(
        'durran',
        password: 'password',
        roles: [ Mongo::Auth::Roles::READ_WRITE ])

Providing credentials
`````````````````````

As is the case for all authentication mechanisms, credentials are either provided at instantiation of the client or when a new client is created via the ``with`` method.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             user: 'test',
                             password: '123')

For MongoDB 2.6 and higher, ``:auth_source`` defaults to **admin**, otherwise the current database is used.

The current database can be changed using the client's ``use`` method.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ])
  music_client = client.use('music')

Then a new client can be created with the authentication credentials.

.. code-block:: ruby

  authenticated_client = client.with(user: 'test',
                                     password: '123')

Alternatively, setting the current database and credentials can be done in one step:

.. code-block:: ruby

  authenticated_music_client = client.with(:database => 'music',
                                           user:'test',
                                           password:'123')


MONGODB-CR mechanism
````````````````````

MONGODB-CR was the default authentication mechanism for MongoDB up through version 2.6.

The mechanism can be explicitly set with the credentials.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             :database => 'music',
                             user: 'test',
                             password: '123',
                             auth_mech: :mongodb_cr)


MONGODB-X509 mechanism
``````````````````````
*Requires MongoDB v2.6 or greater.*

The MONGODB-X509 mechanism authenticates a username derived from the distinguished subject name of the X.509 certificate presented by the driver during SSL negotiation. This authentication method requires the use of SSL connections with certificate validation.

For more information about configuring X.509 authentication in MongoDB,
please see the :manual:`X.509 tutorial in the MongoDB Manual
</tutorial/configure-x509/>`.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             auth_mech: :mongodb_x509,
                             ssl: true,
                             ssl_cert: '/path/to/client.pem',
                             ssl_ca_cert: '/path/to/ca.pem') )


SASL PLAIN (LDAP) mechanism
```````````````````````````
*Requires MongoDB Enterprise Edition v2.6 or greater.*

MongoDB Enterprise Edition supports the SASL PLAIN authentication mechanism which allows you to delegate authentication using a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol `LDAP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP>`_ server. When using SASL PLAIN, passwords are sent to the server in plain text. For this reason, we strongly recommend enabling SSL when using SASL PLAIN as your authentication mechanism.

For more information about configuring SASL PLAIN authentication in
MongoDB, please see the :manual:`SASL/LDAP tutorial in the MongoDB Manual
</tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-authentication/>`.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             auth_mech: :plain,
                             ssl: true,
                             ssl_verify: true,
                             ssl_cert: '/path/to/client.pem',
                             ssl_ca_cert: '/path/to/ca.pem')

GSSAPI (Kerberos) mechanism
```````````````````````````
*Requires MongoDB Enterprise Edition v2.4 or greater.*

MongoDB Enterprise Edition v2.4+ supports GSSAPI (Kerberos) authentication.

In order to use GSSAPI in the Ruby driver with **JRuby**, you must do the following:

1. Specify several system properties so that the underlying GSSAPI Java
   
   libraries can acquire a Kerberos ticket. Please see the `MongoDB Java
   Driver authentication documentation
   <http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.0/driver/reference/connecting/authenticating/#kerberos-gssapi>`_
   for more information.

2. Either provide a password OR set the 'java.security.auth.login.config' system property to a config file that references a keytab file.

In order to use the GSSAPI authentication mechanism in the Ruby driver with **MRI**, you must do the following:

1. Create a ticket-granting ticket using kinit. Please see `this documentation <http://linux.die.net/man/1/kinit>`_ for more information.

For more information about deploying MongoDB with Kerberos
authentication, please see the :manual:`Kerberos documentation in the
MongoDB Manual
</tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication/>`.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             auth_mech: :gssapi,
                             user: 'test',
                             password: '123')


Read Preferences
----------------

Read preferences determine the candidate replica set members to which a query or command can be sent. They consist of a **mode** specified as a symbol, an array of hashes known as **tag_sets**, and two timing options: **local_threshold** and **server_selection_timeout**.

``local_threshold`` defines the upper limit in seconds of the latency window between the nearest server and suitable servers to which an operation may be sent. The default is 15 milliseconds, i.e. 0.015 seconds.

``server_selection_timeout`` defines how long to block for server selection before throwing an exception. The default is 30,000 milliseconds, i.e. 30 seconds.

For more information on the algorithm used to select a server, please
refer to the `Server Selection documentation, available on github
<https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-sel
ection/server-selection.rst>`_.

The read preference is set as an option on the client or passed an option when a command is run on a database.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Set read preference on a client, used for all operations
  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             read: { mode: :secondary,
                                     tag_sets: [{ 'dc' => 'nyc' } ]
                                    })

  # Set read preference for a given command
  client.database.command({ collstats: 'test' }, read: { mode: secondary,
                                                       tag_sets: [{ 'dc' => 'nyc' }]})

Mode
````

There are five possible read preference modes. They are ``:primary``,
``:secondary``, ``:primary_preferred``, ``:secondary_preferred``,
``:nearest``. Please see the :manual:`read preference documentation in the MongoDB Manual
</core/read-preference/>` for an explanation of the modes and tag sets.

Tag sets
````````

The ``tag_sets`` parameter is an ordered list of tag sets used to restrict the eligibility of servers for selection, such as for data center awareness.

A read preference tag set (T) matches a server tag set (S) – or equivalently a server tag set (S) matches a read preference tag set (T) — if T is a subset of S (i.e. T ⊆ S).

For example, the read preference tag set ``{ dc: 'ny', rack: 2 }`` matches a secondary server with tag set ``{ dc: 'ny', rack: 2, size: 'large' }``.

A tag set that is an empty document matches any server, because the empty tag set is a subset of any tag set. This means the default ``tag_sets`` parameter ``[{}]`` matches all servers.


Aggregation
-----------

The aggregation framework is used to process documents and return computed results. An aggregation is defined in the driver by providing a list of pipeline operators and options to a collection view.

``find`` is called on a collection and then ``aggregate`` can be called with a list of pipeline operators.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'demographics')
  coll = client['populations']
  aggregation = coll.find.aggregate([
    { :$group => { :_id => "$city", :total_pop => { :$sum => "$pop" }}}
  ])

  aggregation.each do |doc|
    #=> Yields a BSON::Document.
  end

The MongoDB option, ``allowDiskUse`` can be explicitly set on the aggregation using the ``allow_disk_use`` method:


.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'demographics')
  coll = client['populations']
  aggregation = coll.find.aggregate([ { :$group => { :_id => "$city",
                                                     :total_pop => { :$sum => "$pop" }
                                                   }
                                      }
                                    ])
  aggregation.allow_disk_use(true)

  aggregation.each do |document|
    #=> Yields a BSON::Document.
  end


Bulk Operations
---------------

The bulk write API allows a list of write operations to be sent to the server through one method call. The type of execution can either be ``ordered`` or ``unordered``.

A bulk operation is defined by passing a list of operations to the ``bulk_write`` method on a collection. The second argument to the method is options defining whether the operations should be executed in order and what write concern should be used. The default is ``ordered`` and the collection's write concern will be used if no other is specified.


Each operation is defined as a document with one of the follow keys.

- ``insert_one``
- ``delete_one``
- ``delete_many``
- ``replace_one``
- ``update_one``
- ``update_many``


The format for each operation is the following:

insert_one
``````````

.. code-block:: ruby

    { :insert_one => { :x => 1 } }

delete_one
``````````

.. code-block:: ruby

    { :delete_one => { :x => 1 } }

delete_many
```````````

.. code-block:: ruby

    { :delete_many => { :x => 1 } }

replace_one
```````````

.. code-block:: ruby

    { :replace_one => { :find => { :x => 1 },
                        :replacement => { :x => 2 },
                        :upsert => true } # upsert is optional and defaults to false
     }

update_one
``````````

.. code-block:: ruby

    { :update_one => { :find => { :x => 1 },
                       :update => { '$set' =>  { :x => 2 } },
                       :upsert => true } # upsert is optional and defaults to false
     }

update_many
```````````

.. code-block:: ruby

    { :update_many => { :find => { :x => 1 },
                        :update => { '$set' =>  { :x => 2 } },
                        :upsert => true } # upsert is optional and defaults to false
     }

The follow is an example of a list of operations passed to the ``bulk_write`` method.

.. code-block:: ruby

    coll = client['documents']
    coll.bulk_write([ { :insert_one => { :x => 1 }
                      },
                      { :update_one => { :find => { :x => 1 },
                                         :update => {'$set' => { :x => 2 } }
                                       }
                      },
                      { :replace_one => { :find => { :x => 2 },
                                          :replacement => { :x => 3 }
                                        }
                      }
                    ],
                    :ordered => true )


Logger
------

You can either use the default driver logger or set your own. To set your own:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Logger.logger = other_logger

Please see the `Ruby Logger documentation <http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html>`_
for more information on the default logger API and available levels. To change the logger level:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Logger.logger.level = Logger::WARN


GridFS
------

The driver provides a clean and extremely simple interface to work with storage of
chunked files in the database, also known as the pattern "GridFS".

Files
`````

The core object when working with GridFS in Ruby is a ``Mongo::Grid::File`` object.
This is the object that must be inserted into the database, and when retrieving
files this is the object that is returned.

To create a file with raw data:

.. code-block:: ruby

  file = Mongo::Grid::File.new('I am a file', :filename => 'new-file.txt')

To create a file from a Ruby ``File`` object:

.. code-block:: ruby

  file = File.open('/path/to/my-file.txt')
  grid_file = Mongo::Grid::File.new(file.read, :filename => File.basename(file.path))

To change file options, for example chunk size, pass the options to the constructor:

.. code-block:: ruby

  file = File.open('/path/to/my-file.txt')
  grid_file = Mongo::Grid::File.new(
    file.read,
    :filename => File.basename(file.path),
    :chunk_size => 1024
  )

The following is a full list of the available options that files support.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 80

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - ``:chunk_size``
     - Sets the size of each file chunk in the database.
   * - ``:content_type``
     - Set a content type for the file.
   * - ``:filename`` (Required)
     - The file name.
   * - ``:upload_date``
     - The date the file was uploaded (stored).


Inserting Files
```````````````

Files can be inserted into the database, one at a time. File chunks are inserted
by default into the ``fs.chunks`` collection and file metadata is inserted into the
``fs.files`` collection.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  file = Mongo::Grid::File.new('I am a file', :filename => 'new-file.txt')

  client.database.fs.insert_one(file)

To insert into collections with a name prefix other than `fs`, access the
"filesystem" with a ``:fs_name`` option.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  file = Mongo::Grid::File.new('I am a file', :filename => 'new-file.txt')

  client.database.fs(:fs_name => 'grid').insert_one(file)

Note that the first time the ``fs`` is called, it will create the required index
for you on the ``chunks`` collection. This index is a compound index:

.. code-block:: ruby

  { :files_id => 1, :n => 1 }

Finding Files
`````````````

To retrieve a file from the database, call ``find_one`` with the appropriate filter.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  client.database.fs.find_one(:filename => 'new-file.txt') # Returns a Mongo::Grid::File

Deleting Files
``````````````

To delete a file, pass the file object to ``delete_one``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  fs = client.database.fs
  file = fs.find_one(:filename => 'new-file.txt')
  fs.delete_one(file)


    coll.find.to_a # { '_id' => ..., 'x' => 3 }
