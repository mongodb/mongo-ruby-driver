As of version 3.6 of the MongoDB server, a new ``$changeStream`` pipeline stage is supported in the aggregation
framework. The Ruby driver provides an API for receiving notifications for changes to a particular collection using this
new pipeline stage. Although you can create a change stream using the pipeline operator and aggregation framework
directly, it is recommended to use the driver API described below as the driver resumes the change stream if there is
timeout or network error.

Change streams on the server requires a ``"majority"`` read concern or no read concern.

Change streams do not work properly with JRuby because of the issue documented here_.

.. _here: https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/4212

Namely, JRuby eagerly evaluates ``#next`` on an Enumerator in a background green thread.
So calling ``#next`` on the change stream will cause getmores to be called in a loop in the background.

Watching for changes on a particular collection
-----------------------------------------------

A change stream is created by calling the ``#watch`` method on a collection:

.. code-block:: ruby

  stream = collection.watch
  collection.insert_one(a: 1)
  doc = stream.to_enum.next
  process(doc)


You can also receive the notifications as they are available:

.. code-block:: ruby

  stream = client[:test].watch
  enum = stream.to_enum
  while doc = enum.next
    process(doc)
  end


The change stream can take filters in the aggregation framework pipeline operator format:

.. code-block:: ruby

  stream = collection.watch([{'$match' => { 'operationType' => {'$in' => ['insert', 'replace'] } } },
                             {'$match' => { 'fullDocument.n' => { '$gte' => 1 } } }
                            ])
  enum = stream.to_enum
  while doc = enum.next
    process(doc)
  end

Close a Change Stream
---------------------

You can close a Change Stream by calling the ``#close`` method:

.. code-block:: ruby

  stream = collection.watch
  collection.insert_one(a: 1)
  doc = stream.to_enum.next
  process(doc)
  stream.close
