operations process data records and return
computed results. Aggregation operations group values from
multiple documents together, and can perform a variety of
operations on the grouped data to return a single result.

The Aggregation Pipeline
````````````````````````

The aggregation pipeline is a framework for data aggregation
modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents
enter a multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into
aggregated results.

For a full explanation and a complete list of pipeline stages
and operators, see the
:manual:`manual</core/aggregation-pipeline/>`.

The following example uses the aggregation pipeline on the
``restaurants`` sample dataset to find
a list of the total number of 5-star restaurants, grouped by restaurant
category.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'test')
  coll = client['restaurants']
  aggregation = coll.aggregate([ 
         { '$match'=> { 'stars'=> 5 } },
         { '$unwind'=> '$categories'},
         { '$group'=> { '_id'=> '$categories', 'fiveStars'=> { '$sum'=> 1 } } }
      ])

  aggregation.each do |doc|
    #=> Yields a BSON::Document.
  end

Inside the ``aggregate`` method, the first pipeline stage filters out
all documents except those with ``5`` in the ``stars`` field. The
second stage unwinds the ``categories`` field, which is an array, and
treats each item in the array as a separate document. The third stage
groups the documents by category and adds up the number of matching
5-star results.  

Aggregation pipeline stages have a 
:manual:`maximum memory use limit</core/aggregation-pipeline-limits/#agg-memory-restrictions>`.
To handle large datasets, set the ``allowDiskUse`` option to true to enable
writing data to temporary files.

- You can call the ``allow_disk_use`` method the ``aggregation``
  object to get a new object with the option set:

.. code-block:: ruby

  aggregation = coll.aggregate([ <aggregration pipeline expressions> ])
  aggregation_with_disk_use = aggregation.allow_disk_use(true)

- Or you can pass an option to the ``aggregate`` method:

.. code-block:: ruby

  aggregation = coll.aggregate([ <aggregration pipeline expressions> ],
                                :allow_disk_use => true)

Single Purpose Aggregation Operations
`````````````````````````````````````

MongoDB provides helper methods for some aggregation functions,
including :manual:`count</reference/command/count/>`
and :manual:`distinct</reference/command/distinct/>`.

Count
~~~~~

The following example demonstrates how to use the ``count`` method to
find the total number of documents which have the exact array
``[ 'Chinese', 'Seafood' ]`` in the ``categories`` field.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'test')
  coll = client['restaurants']
  aggregation = coll.count({ 'categories': [ 'Chinese', 'Seafood' ] })

  count = coll.count({ 'categories' => [ 'Chinese', 'Seafood' ] })

Distinct
~~~~~~~~

The ``distinct`` helper method eliminates results which contain
values and returns one record for each unique value.

The following example returns a list of unique values for the
``categories`` field in the ``restaurants`` collection:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'test')
  coll = client['restaurants']
  aggregation = coll.distinct('categories')

  aggregation.each do |doc|
    #=> Yields a BSON::Document.
  end
