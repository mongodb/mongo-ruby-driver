MongoDB supports a variety of 
:manual:`authentication mechanisms </core/authentication/>`.

For more information about configuring your MongoDB server for each of
these authentication mechanisms see MongoDB's 
:manual:`online documentation </tutorial/enable-authentication>`.

Creating a user
```````````````

To create a user in specific database, use the ``create`` method with the
username, password and roles parameters.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client.database.users.create(
        'durran',
        password: 'password',
        roles: [ Mongo::Auth::Roles::READ_WRITE ])
		
.. seealso::
  :manual:`Built-in roles</reference/built-in-roles/>`

Providing credentials
`````````````````````

If authentication is enabled, provide credentials when creating a new
client.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             user: 'test',
                             password: '123' )

For MongoDB 2.6 and later, ``:auth_source`` defaults to **admin**,
otherwise the current database is used.

The current database can be changed with the client's ``use`` method.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ])
  music_client = client.use( 'music')

A new client can be created with the authentication credentials.

.. code-block:: ruby

  authenticated_client = client.with( user: 'test',
                                     password: '123' )

Alternatively, setting the current database and credentials can be done in one step:

.. code-block:: ruby

  authenticated_music_client = client.with( :database => 'music',
                                           user:'test',
                                           password:'123' )


MONGODB-CR Mechanism
````````````````````

*Deprecated:* MONGODB-CR mechanism is deprecated as of MongoDB version 3.6.
Please use SCRAM authentication instead.

MONGODB-CR was the default authentication mechanism for MongoDB up through version 2.6.

The mechanism can be explicitly set with the credentials:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             :database => 'music',
                             user: 'test',
                             password: '123',
                             auth_mech: :mongodb_cr )


Client Certificate (x509)
`````````````````````````
*Requires MongoDB v2.6 or greater.*

The driver presents an X.509 certificate during SSL negotiation.
The Client Certificate (x509) mechanism authenticates a username
derived from the distinguished subject name of this certificate.

This authentication method requires the use of SSL connections with
certificate validation.

For more information about configuring X.509 authentication in MongoDB,
see the :manual:`X.509 tutorial in the MongoDB Manual
</tutorial/configure-x509/>`.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             auth_mech: :mongodb_x509,
                             ssl: true,
                             ssl_cert: '/path/to/client.pem',
                             ssl_ca_cert: '/path/to/ca.pem' )


LDAP (SASL PLAIN) mechanism
```````````````````````````
*Requires MongoDB Enterprise Edition v2.6 or greater.*

MongoDB Enterprise Edition supports the LDAP authentication mechanism
which allows you to delegate authentication using a Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol `LDAP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP>`_ server. 

.. warning::

  When using LDAP, passwords are sent to the server in plain text. For this
  reason, we strongly recommend enabling SSL when using LDAP as your
  authentication mechanism.

For more information about configuring LDAP authentication in
MongoDB, see the :manual:`SASL/LDAP tutorial in the MongoDB Manual
</tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-authentication/>`.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             auth_mech: :plain,
                             ssl: true,
                             ssl_verify: true,
                             ssl_cert: '/path/to/client.pem',
                             ssl_ca_cert: '/path/to/ca.pem' )

Kerberos (GSSAPI) mechanism
```````````````````````````
*Requires MongoDB Enterprise Edition v2.4 or greater.*

MongoDB Enterprise Edition v2.4+ supports Kerberos authentication.

To use Kerberos in the Ruby driver with **JRuby**, do the following:

1. Specify several system properties so that the underlying GSSAPI Java
   libraries can acquire a Kerberos ticket. See the `MongoDB Java
   Driver authentication documentation
   <http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.0/driver/reference/connecting/authenticating/#kerberos-gssapi>`_
   for more information.

2. Either provide a password OR set the 'java.security.auth.login.config'
   system property to a config file that references a keytab file.

To use Kerberos in the Ruby driver
with **Matz's Ruby Interpreter (MRI)**, create a
ticket-granting ticket using ``kinit``. See 
`this documentation <http://linux.die.net/man/1/kinit>`_ for more
information.

For more information about deploying MongoDB with Kerberos
authentication, see the :manual:`manual
</tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication/>`.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             auth_mech: :gssapi,
                             user: 'test',
                             password: '123' )
