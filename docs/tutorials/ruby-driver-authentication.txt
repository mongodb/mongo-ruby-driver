MongoDB supports a variety of
:manual:`authentication mechanisms </core/authentication/>`.

For more information about configuring your MongoDB server for each of
these authentication mechanisms see MongoDB's
:manual:`online documentation </tutorial/enable-authentication>`.

For more information about users and the Ruby driver's helpers for
user management, see the :ref:`User Management tutorial<user-management>`.


Providing credentials
---------------------

If authentication is enabled, provide credentials when creating a new
client:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             user: 'test',
                             password: '123' )

  # If using a URI:
  client = Mongo::Client.new("mongodb://test:123@127.0.0.1:27017")

Authentication credentials can be changed on a client instance to obtain
a new client using the ``Client#with`` method:

.. code-block:: ruby

  authenticated_client = client.with( user: 'another-user',
                                      password: '123' )

It is also possible to change the client's database and credentials in
one step:

.. code-block:: ruby

  authenticated_music_client = client.with( database: 'music',
                                            user:'test',
                                            password:'123' )


.. _auth-source:

Auth Source
-----------

A user's auth source is the database where that user's authentication
credentials are stored.

The user's auth source may be specified whenever the credentials are specified:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             database: 'mydb',
                             user: 'test',
                             password: '123',
                             auth_source: 'admin' )

  # If using a URI:
  client = Mongo::Client.new("mongodb://test:123@127.0.0.1:27017/mydb?authSource=admin")

If no auth source is specified, then a default will be assumed by the client.
The default auth source depends on the authentication mechanism that is being
used to connect.

For the ``MONGODB-CR``, ``SCRAM-SHA-1``, and ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` authentication
mechanisms, the default auth source is the database to which the client is
connecting; if no database is specified, ``admin`` database is the default
database and hence the default auth source. For the ``PLAIN`` mechanism (LDAP),
the default auth source is the database to which the client is connecting;
if no database is specified, the ``$external`` database is used as the
auth source. For the ``GSSAPI`` and ``MONGODB_X509`` mechanisms, the
auth source is always ``$external``.

.. note::

  When changing the database using the ``with`` method, the auth source is
  determined in the new ``Client`` instance using the full set of options
  that applies to it. For example, if the original client had an auth source
  specified, this auth source would take precedence over the database
  given in the ``with`` call. If the original client did not have an auth
  source specified, the new database would be the new auth source, subject
  to the rules of the authentication mechanism used.


Authentication Mechanisms
-------------------------

.. _scram:

SCRAM
`````

:manual:`SCRAM authentication </core/security-scram/>` is the default
authentication mechanism for MongoDB. There are two SCRAM mechanisms in
MongoDB: SCRAM-SHA-1 (available as of MongoDB 3.0) and SCRAM-SHA-256
(available as of MongoDB 4.0). If an authentication mechanism is not
specified but user credentials are, the driver will attempt to use SCRAM
authentication on server 3.0 or newer and will negotiate the mechanism
to use based on the server version and the mechanisms defined for a
particular user (it is possible to configure a user in the server to only
allow SCRAM-SHA-1 mechanism, only SCRAM-SHA-256 mechanism or both).

To explicitly specify SCRAM-SHA-1 as the authentication mechanism, use the
``auth_mech: :scram`` Ruby client option or the ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` as the value
for the ``authMechanism`` URI option, as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             database: 'mydb',
                             user: 'test',
                             password: '123',
                             auth_mech: :scram )

  client = Mongo::Client.new("mongodb://test:123@127.0.0.1:27017/mydb?authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-1")

To explicitly specify SCRAM-SHA-256 as the authentication mechanism, use the
``auth_mech: :scram256`` Ruby client option or the ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` as the
value for the ``authMechanism`` URI option, as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             database: 'mydb',
                             user: 'test',
                             password: '123',
                             auth_mech: :scram256 )

  client = Mongo::Client.new("mongodb://test:123@127.0.0.1:27017/mydb?authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256")


Client Certificate (X.509)
``````````````````````````

The driver presents an X.509 certificate during SSL negotiation.
The MONGODB-X509 authentication mechanism authenticates a username
derived from the distinguished subject name of this certificate.

This authentication method requires the use of SSL connections with
certificate validation.

To authenticate the client, you will need a valid SSL certificate
and private encryption key. These can be stored in separate files,
or together in one file (in the PEM format). Even if the certificate
and private key are stored in the same file, you must specify the path to
that file by passing both the ``ssl_cert`` and ``ssl_key`` options
to the client.

For more information about configuring X.509 authentication in MongoDB,
see the :manual:`X.509 tutorial in the MongoDB Manual
</tutorial/configure-x509/>`.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             auth_mech: :mongodb_x509,
                             ssl: true,
                             ssl_cert: '/path/to/client.pem',
                             ssl_key: '/path/to/client.pem',
                             ssl_ca_cert: '/path/to/ca.pem' )


LDAP (SASL PLAIN)
`````````````````

*Requires MongoDB Enterprise Edition.*

MongoDB Enterprise Edition supports the LDAP authentication mechanism
which allows you to delegate authentication using a Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol `LDAP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP>`_ server.

.. warning::

  When using LDAP, passwords are sent to the server in plain text. For this
  reason, we strongly recommend enabling SSL when using LDAP as your
  authentication mechanism.

For more information about configuring LDAP authentication in
MongoDB, see the :manual:`SASL/LDAP tutorial in the MongoDB Manual
</tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-authentication/>`.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             auth_mech: :plain,
                             ssl: true,
                             ssl_verify: true,
                             ssl_cert: '/path/to/client.pem',
                             ssl_ca_cert: '/path/to/ca.pem' )


.. _kerberos:

Kerberos (GSSAPI)
`````````````````

*Requires MongoDB Enterprise Edition.*

MongoDB Enterprise Edition supports Kerberos authentication.

To use Kerberos authentication from Ruby,
`mongo_kerberos <https://rubygems.org/gems/mongo_kerberos>`_ must be
installed. Add to your ``Gemfile``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  gem 'mongo'
  gem 'mongo_kerberos'

... and in your application:

.. code-block:: ruby

  require 'mongo'
  require 'mongo_kerberos'

To use Kerberos in the Ruby driver with **MRI**, create a ticket-granting
ticket using ``kinit``. See
`this documentation <http://linux.die.net/man/1/kinit>`_ for more
information.

To use Kerberos in the Ruby driver with **JRuby**, do the following:

1. Specify several system properties so that the underlying GSSAPI Java
   libraries can acquire a Kerberos ticket. See the `MongoDB Java
   Driver authentication documentation
   <http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.0/driver/reference/connecting/authenticating/#kerberos-gssapi>`_
   for more information.

2. Either provide a password OR set the 'java.security.auth.login.config'
   system property to a config file that references a keytab file.

For more information about deploying MongoDB with Kerberos
authentication, see the :manual:`manual
</tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication/>`.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             auth_mech: :gssapi,
                             user: 'test',
                             password: '123' )


MONGODB-CR
``````````

*Deprecated:* MONGODB-CR mechanism is deprecated as of MongoDB 3.6 and
removed as of MongoDB 4.0. Please use `SCRAM authentication <scram>`_ instead.

MONGODB-CR was the default authentication mechanism for MongoDB up through
version 2.6.

The mechanism can be explicitly set with the credentials:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ],
                             database: 'music',
                             user: 'test',
                             password: '123',
                             auth_mech: :mongodb_cr )
