.. _query-cache:

The MongoDB Ruby driver provides a built-in query cache. When enabled, the
query cache saves the results of previously-executed find and aggregation
queries. When those same queries are performed again, the driver returns
the cached reuslts to prevent unnecessary roundtrips to the database.

Usage
=====

The query cache is disabled by default. It cache can be enabled on the global
scope as well as within the context of a specific block.

To enable the query cache globally:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::QueryCache.enabled = true

Similarly, to disable it globally:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::QueryCache.enabled = false

To enable the query cache within the context of a block:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::QueryCache.cache do
    Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], database: 'music') do |client|
      client['artists'].find(name: 'Flying Lotus').first
      #=> Queries the database and caches the result

      client['artists'].find(name: 'Flying Lotus').first
      #=> Returns the previously cached result
    end
  end

And to disable the query cache in the context of a block:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::QueryCache.uncached do
    Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], database: 'music') do |client|
      client['artists'].find(name: 'Flying Lotus').first
      #=> Sends the query to the database; does NOT cache the result

      client['artists'].find(name: 'Flying Lotus').first
      #=> Queries the database again
    end
  end

You may check whether the query cache is enabled at any time by calling
``Mongo::QueryCache.enabled?``, which will return ``true`` or ``false``.

.. _query-cache-matching:

Query Matching
==============

A query is eligible to use cached results if it matches the original query
that produced the cached results. Two queries are considered matching if they
are identical in the following values:

* Namespace (the database and collection on which the query was performed)
* Selector (for aggregations, the aggregation pipeline stages)
* Skip
* Sort
* Projection
* Collation
* Read Concern
* Read Preference

For example, if you perform one query, and then perform a mostly identical query
with a different sort order, those queries will not be considered matching,
and the second query will not use the cached results of the first.

Limits
======

When performing a query with a limit, the query cache will reuse an existing
cached query with a larger limit if one exists. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::QueryCache.cache do
    Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], database: 'music') do |client|
      client['artists'].find(genre: 'Rock', limit: 10)
      #=> Queries the database and caches the result

      client['artists'].find(genre: 'Rock', limit: 5)
      #=> Returns the first 5 results from the cached query

      client['artists'].find(genre: 'Rock', limit: 20)
      #=> Queries the database again and replaces the previously cached query results
    end
  end

Cache Invalidation
==================

The query cache is cleared in part or in full on every write operation. Most
write operations will clear the results of any queries were performed on the same
collection that is being written to. Some operations will clear the entire
query cache.

The following operations will clear cached query results on the same database and
collection (including during bulk writes):

* ``insert_one``
* ``update_one``
* ``replace_one``
* ``update_many``
* ``delete_one``
* ``delete_many``
* ``find_one_and_delete``
* ``find_one_and_update``
* ``find_one_and_replace``

The following operations will clear the entire query cache:

* aggregation with ``$merge`` or ``$out`` pipeline stages
* ``commit_transaction``
* ``abort_transaction``

Manual Cache Invalidation
=========================

You may clear the query cache at any time with the following method:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::QueryCache.clear

This will remove all cached query results.

Transactions
============

Queries are cached within the context of a transaction, but the entire
cache will be cleared when the transaction is committed or aborted.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::QueryCache.cache do
    Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], database: 'music') do |client|
      session = client.start_session

      session.with_transaction do
        client['artists'].insert_one({ name: 'Fleet Foxes' }, session: session)

        client['artists'].find({}, session: session).first
        #=> { name: 'Fleet Foxes' }
        #=> Queries the database and caches the result

        client['artists'].find({}, session: session).first
        #=> { name: 'Fleet Foxes' }
        #=> Returns the previously cached result

        session.abort_transaction
      end

      client['artists'].find.first
      #=> nil
      # The query cache was cleared on abort_transaction
    end
  end

.. note::

  Transactions are often performed with a "snapshot" read concern level. Keep
  in mind that a query with a "snapshot" read concern cannot return cached
  results from a query without the "snapshot" read concern, so it is possible
  that a transaction may not use previously cached queries.

  To understand when a query will use a cached result, see the
  :ref:`Query Matching <query-cache-matching>` section.

Aggregations
============

The query cache also caches the results of aggregation pipelines. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::QueryCache.cache do
    Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], database: 'music') do |client|
      client['artists'].aggregate([ { '$match' => { name: 'Fleet Foxes' } } ]).first
      #=> Queries the database and caches the result

      client['artists'].aggregate([ { '$match' => { name: 'Fleet Foxes' } } ]).first
      #=> Returns the previously cached result
    end
  end

.. note::

  Aggregation results are cleared from the cache during every write operation,
  with no exceptions.
