No Server is Available Matching Preference
==========================================

If you receive the following error:

.. code-block:: ruby

  > client[:contacts].insert_one({ vpa: 'cool@cool'})
  Mongo::Error::NoServerAvailable: No server is available matching preference: #<Mongo::ServerSelector::Primary:0x14987080 tag_sets=[] max_staleness=nil> using server_selection_timeout=30 and local_threshold=0.015

This error was produced on Ruby Driver version 2.6.x and earlier. This error is
raised when the driver is unable to connect to the server. In order to solve
this, you can try the following:

- Update the driver to the most recent 2.x release.
- Ensure that the port number is correct in the URI/connection string, or the
  host list.
- If you are connecting to Atlas, ensure that the firewall rules are configured
  correctly. See the documentation on `Cluster Security <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/setup-cluster-security/>`_.
- If your application uses a forking web server, see the documentation on :ref:`Forking <forking>`.

``OperationFailure`` When Reading ``local`` Database With Auth On
=================================================================

If you are getting the following error when trying to read the ``local`` database:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Error::OperationFailure: not authorized on local to execute command { find: "oplog.rs", filter: { ts:
    { $gte: Timestamp 1497449043000|0 } }, sort: { $natural: 1 } } (13)

You can fix this by adjusting the roles your user has and ensuring that it has
privileges to the local database. If you specifically want to access the oplog,
you can also create a custom role with read access to the local database's
``oplog.rs`` collection. You can find more information about role management
`here <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/js-role-management/>`_.

``SocketTimeoutError`` and name resolution errors on EC2
========================================================

Some users reported getting the following error:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Exception
  Mongo::Error::SocketTimeoutError
  Error
  execution expired
  /var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/mongo-2.5.0/lib/mongo/socket/ssl.rb:57:in `pack_sockaddr_in'

  /var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems/mongo-2.5.0/lib/mongo/server/connection.rb:256:in `write'

This error was last reported on Ruby Driver version 2.5.1, so updating the driver
can potentially solve this issue. A user has reported that they solved this issue
as follows:

  DNS servers on EC2 are generated in /etc/resolv.conf by default. Following
  the answer `here <https://askubuntu.com/questions/157154/how-do-i-include-lines-in-resolv-conf-that-wont-get-lost-on-reboot?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa>`_
  and setting the nameservers to Google NS I was able to fix this issue.

``Mongo::Auth::Unauthorized`` User is Not Authorized to Access
==============================================================

Some users reported getting the following error:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Auth::Unauthorized: User ... is not authorized to access ...

After upgrading to Ruby Driver version 2.5+, the driver was changed to use
the scram authorization mechanism by default. This error might be happen if the
authorization mechanism your user was created with does not match the
authorization mechanism used by the driver. You can specify the preferred
authorization mechanism using the ``auth_mech`` option in your ``mongoid.yml``
file.

`RUBY-1281 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/RUBY-1684>`_.
