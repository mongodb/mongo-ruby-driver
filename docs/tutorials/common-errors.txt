.. code-block:: ruby

  > client[:contacts].insert_one({ vpa: 'cool@cool'})
  Mongo::Error::NoServerAvailable: No server is available matching preference: #<Mongo::ServerSelector::Primary:0x14987080 tag_sets=[] max_staleness=nil> using server_selection_timeout=30 and local_threshold=0.015

This error was produced on Ruby Driver version 2.6.x and earlier. This error is
raised when the driver is unable to connect to the server. In order to solve
this, you can try the following:

- Update the driver to the most recent 2.x release.
- Ensure that the port number is correct in the URI/connection string, or the
  host list.
- If you are connecting to Atlas, ensure that the firewall rules are configured
  correctly. See the documentation on `Cluster Security <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/setup-cluster-security/>`_.
- If your application uses a forking web server, see the documentation on :ref:`Forking <forking>`.

``OperationFailure`` When Reading ``local`` Database With Auth On
=================================================================

If you are getting the following error when trying to read the ``local`` database:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Error::OperationFailure: not authorized on local to execute command { find: "oplog.rs", filter: { ts:
    { $gte: Timestamp 1497449043000|0 } }, sort: { $natural: 1 } } (13)

You can fix this by adjusting the roles your user has and ensuring that it has
privileges to the local database. If you specifically want to access the oplog,
you can also create a custom role with read access to the local database's
``oplog.rs`` collection. You can find more information about role management
`here <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/js-role-management/>`_.

`MONGOID-4446 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-4446>`_.
