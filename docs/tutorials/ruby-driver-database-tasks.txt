Databases
---------

The driver provides various helpers on database objects for executing
commands, getting collection lists, and administrative tasks.

List Collections
````````````````

To get a list of collections or collection names for a database, use
``collections`` and ``collection_names``, respectively.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  database = client.database

  database.collections      # Returns an array of Collection objects.
  database.collection_names # Returns an array of collection names as strings.

Arbitrary Comands
`````````````````

To execute any command on the database, use the ``command`` method.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  database = client.database

  result = database.command(:ismaster => 1)
  result.first # Returns the BSON::Document returned from the server.

Drop Database
`````````````

To drop a database, use the ``drop`` method.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  client.database.drop
