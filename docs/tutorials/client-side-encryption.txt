New in MongoDB 4.2, client-side encryption allows administrators and developers
to encrypt specific fields in MongoDB documents before inserting them into the
database.

With client-side encryption, developers can encrypt fields client-side without
any server-side configuration or directives. Client-side field-level encryption
supports workloads where applications must guarantee that unauthorized parties,
including server administrators, cannot read the encrypted data.

Installation
------------

Client-side encryption requires the installation of additional packages.

libmongocrypt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libmongocrypt is a C library used by the driver for client-side encryption.
To use client-side encryption, you must install the libmongocrypt binary
on the machine running your Ruby program.

To download a pre-built binary:

- Download a tarball of all libmongocrypt variations from this `AWS bucket <https://s3.amazonaws.com/mciuploads/libmongocrypt/all/master/latest/libmongocrypt-all.tar.gz>`_.

- Unzip the file you downloaded. You will see a list of folders, each
  corresponding to an operating system. Find the folder that matches your
  operating system and open it.

- Inside that folder, open the folder called "nocrypto." In either the
  lib or lb64 folder, you will find the libmongocrypt.so or
  libmongocrypt.dylib or libmongocrypt.dll file, depending on your OS.

- Move that file to wherever you want to keep it on your machine. You may delete
  the other files included in the tarball.

To build binary from source:

- Follow the instructions in the README on the `libmongocrypt GitHub repo <https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt>`_.

Once you have the libmongocrypt binary on your machine, specify the path to the
binary using the LIBMONGOCRYPT_PATH environment variable. It is recommended that
you add this variable to your rc files. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  export LIBMONGOCRYPT_PATH=/path/to/your/libmongocrypt.so

mongocryptd
~~~~~~~~~~~

Mongocryptd is a daemon that tells the driver which fields to encrypt in a
given operation. It is only required for automatic encryption, which is an
enterprise-only feature. If you only intend to use explicit encryption, you may
skip this step.

Mongocryptd comes pre-packaged with enterprise builds of the MongoDB server
(versions 4.2 and newer). If you must install mongocryptd separately, follow
the `installation instructions in the MongoDB manual <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/security-client-side-encryption-appendix/#installation>`_.

Automatic Encryption
--------------------

Automatic encryption is a feature that allows users to configure a
``Mongo::Client`` instance to always encrypt specific document fields when
performing database operations. Once the ``Mongo::Client`` is configured, it
will automatically encrypt any field that requires encryption before writing
it to the database, and it will automatically decrypt those fields when reading
them. Automatic encryption is an enterprise-only feature.

The following example provides a demonstration of auto-encryption using a local
master key.

.. code-block:: ruby

  require 'mongo'

  # Generate a local encryption master key
  local_master_key = Base64.encode64(SecureRandom.random_bytes(96))

  kms_providers = {
    local: {
      key: local_master_key
    }
  }

  # Create an encryption data key and insert it into the key vault collection
  key_vault_client = Mongo::Client.new(['localhost:27017'])

  client_encryption = Mongo::ClientEncryption.new(
    key_vault_client,
    {
      key_vault_namespace: 'admin.datakeys',
      kms_providers: kms_providers
    }
  )

  data_key_id = client_encryption.create_data_key('local')

  # Create schema map
  schema_map = {
    'encryption_db.encryption_coll': {
      properties: {
        encrypted_field: {
          encrypt: {
            keyId: [BSON::Binary.new(data_key_id, :uuid)],
            bsonType: "string",
            algorithm: "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic"
          }
        }
      },
      bsonType: "object"
    }
  }

  # Configure client for automatic encryption
  client = Mongo::Client.new(
    ['localhost:27017'],
    auto_encryption_options: {
      key_vault_namespace: 'admin.datakeys',
      kms_providers: kms_providers,
      schema_map: schema_map
    }
  )

  collection = client.use(:encryption_db)[:encryption_coll]
  collection.drop # Make sure there is no data in the collection

  # The string "sensitive data" will be encrypted and stored in the database
  # as ciphertext
  collection.insert_one(encrypted_field: 'sensitive data')

  # The data is decrypted before being returned to the user
  collection.find(encrypted_field: 'sensitive data').first['encrypted_field']
  # => "sensitive data"

  # A client with no auto_encryption_options is unable to decrypt the data
  client_no_encryption = Mongo::Client.new(['localhost:27017'])
  client_no_encryption.use(:encryption_db)[:encryption_coll].find.first['encrypted_field']
  # => <BSON::Binary...>
