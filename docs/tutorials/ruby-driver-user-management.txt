Removing users
``````````````
To remove a user from the database, use the ``remove`` method:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client.database.users.remove('ada')

Optionally, you may pass a ``Hash`` of options as a second argument.
The only option currently supported is ``:write_concern``, which specifies
the write concern of the operation if you are running this command against
a replica set.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client.database.users.remove('ada', { w: "majority" , wtimeout: 5000 })

.. seealso::
  :manual:`Write Concerns</core/replica-set-write-concern/>`

The Ruby Driver does not implement a method for removing all users
from a database.
