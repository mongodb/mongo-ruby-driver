Removing users
``````````````
To remove a user from the database, use the ``remove`` method:

.. code-block:: ruby
  client.database.users.remove('ada')

Optimonally, you may pass a ``Hash`` of options as a second argument.
The only option currently supported is :write_concern, which specifies
the write concern of the operation if you are running this command against
a replica set.

.. code-block:: ruby
  client.database.users.remove('ada')

.. seealso::
  :manual:`Write Concern</reference/replica-set-write-concern/>`

The Ruby Driver does not implement a method for removing all users
from a database.
