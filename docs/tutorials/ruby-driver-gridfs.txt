The driver provides a clean and simple interface to work with storage of
chunked files in the database, also known as the pattern "GridFS". The API allows you to either
work with Grid::File objects or with read and write streams.

Creating a GridFS object ("Grid::FSBucket")
-------------------------------------------

You can create a GridFS object by calling ``fs`` on a database, with optional
arguments. ``fs`` returns a ``Grid::FSBucket`` object.

The options that ``Grid::FSBucket`` supports are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 80

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - ``:bucket_name``
     - The name of the GridFS Bucket. Default is ``fs``.
   * - ``:fs_name``
     - The name of the GridFS Bucket. Takes precedence over ``bucket_name``. Default is ``fs``.
   * - ``:chunk_size``
     - Specifies the size of each file chunk in the database.
   * - ``:write``
     - The write concern used when uploading files.
   * - ``:read``
     - The read preference used when downloading files.


For example, you can create a GridFS bucket object with a particular read preference:

.. code-block:: ruby

  fs_bucket = database.fs( read: { mode: :secondary } )


Working with write streams
--------------------------

To upload a file to GridFS using a write stream, you can either open a stream and write to it directly or write the
entire contents of an IO object to GridFS all at once.

To open an upload stream and write to it:

.. code-block:: ruby

  file = File.open('/path/to/my-file.txt', 'r')
  fs_bucket.open_upload_stream('my-file.txt') do |stream|
    stream.write(file)
  end
  file.close

To upload the entire contents of an IO object in one call:

.. code-block:: ruby

  file = File.open('/path/to/my-file.txt', 'r')
  fs_bucket.upload_from_stream('my-file.txt', file)
  file.close


Working with read streams
-------------------------

To download a file from GridFS using a read stream, you can either open a read stream and read from it directly or
download the entire file all at once.

To open a download stream and read from it:

.. code-block:: ruby

  file = File.open('/path/to/my-output-file.txt', 'w')
  fs_bucket.open_download_stream(file_id) do |stream|
    file.write(stream.read)
  end
  file.close

To download the file all at once and write it to an IO object:

.. code-block:: ruby

  file = File.open('/path/to/my-output-file.txt', 'w')
  fs_bucket.download_from_stream(file_id, file)
  file.close

You can also download a file specified by a name and (optionally)
revision number. Revision numbers are used to distinguish
between files sharing the same name, ordered by date of upload. The revision number passed to
``open_download_stream_by_name`` can be positive or negative.

.. code-block:: ruby

  file = File.open('/path/to/my-output-file.txt', 'w')
  fs_bucket.open_download_stream_by_name('my-file.txt', revision: -2) do |stream|
    file.write(stream.read)
  end
  file.close

To download the entire contents of the file specified by name and (optionally)
revision number:

.. code-block:: ruby

  file = File.open('/path/to/my-output-file.txt', 'w')
  fs_bucket.download_to_stream_by_name('my-file.txt', file, revision: -2)
  file.close


Finding file metadata
---------------------

You can retrieve documents containing metadata about files in the GridFS files collection.

.. code-block:: ruby

  fs_bucket.find(filename: 'my-file.txt')

Deleting files
--------------

You can delete a file by id.

.. code-block:: ruby

  fs_bucket.delete(file_id)


Working with Grid::File objects
-------------------------------

This object can be used to wrap a file to be inserted into the database using GridFS and the object that is retrieved.

To create a file with raw data:

.. code-block:: ruby

  file = Mongo::Grid::File.new('I am a file', :filename => 'new-file.txt')

To create a file from a Ruby ``File`` object:

.. code-block:: ruby

  file = File.open('/path/to/my-file.txt')
  grid_file = Mongo::Grid::File.new(file.read, :filename => File.basename(file.path))

To change file options such as chunk size, pass options to the constructor:

.. code-block:: ruby

  file = File.open('/path/to/my-file.txt')
  grid_file = Mongo::Grid::File.new(
    file.read,
    :filename => File.basename(file.path),
    :chunk_size => 1024
  )

The following is a full list of the available options that files support.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 80

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - ``:chunk_size``
     - Sets the size of each file chunk in the database.
   * - ``:content_type``
     - Set a content type for the file.
   * - ``:filename`` (Required)
     - The file name.
   * - ``:upload_date``
     - The date the file was uploaded (stored).


Inserting Files
---------------

Files can be inserted into the database one at a time. File chunks are inserted
by default into the ``fs.chunks`` collection and file metadata is inserted into the
``fs.files`` collection.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  file = Mongo::Grid::File.new('I am a file', :filename => 'new-file.txt')

  client.database.fs.insert_one(file)

To insert into collections with a name prefix other than `fs`, access the
filesystem with a ``:fs_name`` option.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  file = Mongo::Grid::File.new('I am a file', :filename => 'new-file.txt')

  client.database.fs(:fs_name => 'grid').insert_one(file)

Note that the first time a file is inserted, it will create the required index
for you on the ``chunks`` collection. This index is a compound index:

.. code-block:: ruby

  { :files_id => 1, :n => 1 }

Files can also be streamed as an alternative to a direct insert.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client.database.fs.open_upload_stream(filename) do |stream|
    stream.write(file)
  end

Finding Files
-------------

To retrieve a file from the database, call ``find_one`` with the appropriate filter.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  client.database.fs.find_one(:filename => 'new-file.txt') # Returns a Mongo::Grid::File

Files can also be streamed as an alternative to a direct find.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client.database.fs.open_download_stream(file_id) do |stream|
    io.write(stream.read)
  end

  fs.download_to_stream(file_id, io)


Deleting Files
--------------

To delete a file, pass the file object to ``delete_one``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  fs = client.database.fs
  file = fs.find_one(:filename => 'new-file.txt')
  fs.delete_one(file)


    coll.find.to_a # { '_id' => ..., 'x' => 3 }
