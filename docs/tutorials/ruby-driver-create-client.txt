Using ``Mongo::Client``
-----------------------

To connect to a MongoDB deployment, create a ``Mongo::Client`` object.
Provide a list of hosts and options or a :manual:`connection string URI
</reference/connection-string/>` to the``Mongo::Client`` constructor.
The client's selected database defaults to ``admin``.

By default, the driver will automatically detect the topology used by the
deployment and connect appropriately.

To connect to a local standalone MongoDB deployment, specify the host and
port of the server. In most cases you would also specify the database name
to connect to; if no database name is specified, the client will use the
``admin`` database:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], database: 'mydb')
  
  # Or using the URI syntax:
  Mongo::Client.new("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mydb")

.. note::

  The hostname ``localhost`` is treated specially by the driver and will
  be resolved to IPv4 addresses only.

To `connect to MongoDB Atlas <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/driver-connection/>`,
specify the Atlas deployment URI:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new("mongodb+srv://username:myRealPassword@cluster0.mongodb.net/mydb?w=majority")

The driver will discover all nodes in the cluster and connect to them as
needed.


Database
````````

Usually the client will connect to a specific database. It is possible to
change the active database by calling ``Client#use`` to obtain a new ``Client``
instance configured to use the new database. For example, it is common to
perform operations on the ``admin`` database:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], database: 'mydb')
  admin_client = client.use('admin')
  # Issue an administrative command
  admin_client.database.command(replSetGetConfig: 1).documents.first


Direct Connection
`````````````````

If the deployment is a replica set, the driver will by default discover all
members of the replica set given the address of any one member, and will
dispatch operations to the appropriate member (for example, writes would be
dispatched to the primary).

To force all operations to be performed on the designated server, specify the
``direct_connection`` option:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new([ '1.2.3.4:27017' ], database: 'mydb', direct_connection: true)
  
  # Or using the URI syntax:
  Mongo::Client.new("mongodb://1.2.3.4:27017/mydb?directConnection=true")


.. _ruby-driver-connect-replica-set:

Replica Set Connection
``````````````````````

To connect to a :manual:`replica set</replication/>` deployment managed by a
service providing SRV URIs (such as MongoDB Atlas), connect to the URI:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new("mongodb+srv://username:myRealPassword@cluster0.mongodb.net/test?w=majority")

If not using SRV URIs, it is sufficient to pass the address of any node in the
replica set to the driver; the driver will then automatically discover the
remaining nodes. However, it is recommended to specify all nodes that are part
of the replica set, so that in the event of one or more nodes being unavailable
(for example, due to maintenance or reconfiguration) the driver can still
connect to the replica set.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017', '127.0.0.1:27018' ],
    :database => 'mydb', replica_set: 'myapp')
  
  # Or using the URI syntax:
  Mongo::Client.new("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017,127.0.0.1:27018/mydb?replicaSet=myapp")


.. _ruby-driver-connect-sharded-cluster:

Sharded Cluster Connection
``````````````````````````

To connect to a :manual:`sharded cluster</sharding/>` deployment managed by a
service providing SRV URIs (such as MongoDB Atlas), connect to the URI:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new("mongodb+srv://username:myRealPassword@cluster0.mongodb.net/test?w=majority")

When the driver connects to a sharded cluster via an SRV URI, it will monitor
the SRV records of the address specified in the URI for changes and will
automatically add and remove ``mongos`` hosts to/from its list of servers as
they are added and removed to/from the sharded cluster.

If not using SRV URIs, pass the addresses of one or more
:manual:`mongos</reference/program/mongos/>` hosts. Unlike with
replica set deployments, the driver is not able to discover all ``mongos``
nodes in a sharded cluster when not using SRV URIs. It is not required that all
``mongos`` node addresses are given to the driver - the driver will balance
the operation load among the nodes it is given. Specifying more nodes will
spread the operation load accordingly.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new([ '1.2.3.4:27017', '1.2.3.5:27017' ], :database => 'mydb')
  
  Mongo::Client.new("mongodb://1.2.3.4:27017,1.2.3.5:27017/mydb")


SRV URIs
````````

When the driver connects to a
:manual:`mongodb+srv protocol <reference/connection-string/#dns-seedlist-connection-format>`
URI, keep in mind the following:

1. SRV URI lookup is performed synchronously when the client is constructed.
  If this lookup fails for any reason, client construction will fail with an
  exception. When a client is constructed with a list of hosts, the driver
  will attempt to contact and monitor those hosts for as long as the client
  object exists. If one of these hosts does not resolve initially but becomes
  resolvable later, the driver will be able to establish a connection to such
  a host when it becomes available. The initial SRV URI lookup must succeed
  on the first attempt; subsequent host lookups will be retried by the driver
  as needed.
2. The driver looks up URI options in the DNS TXT records corresponding to the
  SRV records. These options can be overridden by URI options specified in the
  URI and by Ruby options, in this order.
3. If the topology of the constructed ``Client`` object is unknown or a
  sharded cluster, the driver will begin monitoring the specified SRV DNS
  records for changes and will automatically update the list of servers in the
  cluster. The updates will stop if the topology becomes a single or a replica
  set.


.. _ruby-driver-client-options:

Client Options
--------------

``Mongo::Client``'s constructor accepts a number of options configuring the
behavior of the driver. The options can be provided in the options hash as
Ruby options, in the URI as URI options, or both. If both a Ruby option and
the analogous URI option are provided, the Ruby option takes precedence.

       are no available connections, and the total number of established
       connections to the target server is below ``:max_pool_size``.
       However, once connections to a particular server are created, up to

     - ``Hash``
     -  ``{ :mode => :primary }``

   * - ``:read_concern``

     - Since the client begins monitoring the deployment in background as
       soon as it is constructed, constructing a client and then subscribing
       to `SDAM <sdam>`_ events in a separate statement may result in the
       subscriber not receiving some of the SDAM events. The ``:sdam_proc``
       option permits adding event subscribers on the client being constructed
       before any SDAM events are published.
       
       Pass a ``Proc`` which will be called with the ``Client`` as the argument
       after the client's event subscription mechanism has been initialized
       but before any of the servers are added to the client. Use this
       ``Proc`` to set up SDAM event subscribers on the client.
       
       Note: the client is not fully constructed when the ``Proc`` provided in
       ``:sdam_proc is invoked, in particular the cluster is nil at this time.
       ``:sdam_proc`` procedure should limit itself to calling
       ``Client#subscribe`` and ``Client#unsubscribe`` methods on on the
       passed client only.

     - false

   * - ``:ssl_ca_cert``
     - The file path containing concatenated certificate authority certificates used to validate certs
       passed from the other end of the connection. One of :ssl_ca_cert, :ssl_ca_cert_string or :ssl_ca_cert_object
       (in order of priority) is required for :ssl_verify.
     - ``String``
     - none

   * - ``:ssl_ca_cert_object``
     - An array of OpenSSL::X509::Certificate representing the certificate authority certificates used to
       validate certs passed from the other end of the connection. One of :ssl_ca_cert, :ssl_ca_cert_string or

     - ``String``
     - none

   * - ``:ssl_cert``
     - Path to the client certificate file used to identify the application to
       the MongoDB servers. The file may also contain the certificate's private
       key; if so, the private key is ignored by this option. The file may
       also contain intermediate certificates forming the certificate chain
       from the client certificate to the CA certificate; any intermediate
       certificates will be parsed by the driver and provided to the OpenSSL
       context in ``extra_chain_cert`` attribute. If intermediate certificates
       are provided, they must follow the client certificate which must be
       the first certificate in the file.

       This option, if present, takes precedence over ``:ssl_cert_string`` and
       ``:ssl_cert_object`` options.
     - ``String``
     - none

   * - ``:ssl_cert_object``
     - The OpenSSL::X509::Certificate used to identify the application to
       the MongoDB servers. Only one certificate may be passed through this

     - none

   * - ``:ssl_cert_string``
     - A string containing the PEM-encoded certificate used to identify the
       application to the MongoDB servers. The string may also contain the
       certificate's private key; if so, the private key is ignored by this
       option. The string may also contain intermediate certificates forming
       the certificate chain from the client certificate to the CA certificate;
       any intermediate certificates will be parsed by the driver and provided
       to the OpenSSL context in ``extra_chain_cert`` attribute. If intermediate
       certificates are provided, they must follow the client certificate which
       must be the first certificatet in the string.

       This option, if present, takes precedence over the ``:ssl_cert_object``
       option.
     - ``String``
     - none

   * - ``:ssl_key``
     - The private keyfile used to identify the connection against MongoDB. Note that even if the key is stored in

       This parameter, if present, takes precedence over the value of option :ssl_key_object.
     - ``String``
     - none

   * - ``:ssl_verify``
     - Whether to perform peer certificate validation and hostname verification. Note that
       the decision of whether to validate certificates will be overridden if
       :ssl_verify_certificate is set, and the decision of whether to validate hostnames will be
       overridden if :ssl_verify_hostname is set.
     - ``Boolean``
     - true

   * - ``:ssl_verify_certificate``
     - Whether to perform peer certificate validation. This setting overrides :ssl_verify with
       respect to whether certificate validation is performed.
     - ``Boolean``

   * - ``:write_concern``
     - Specifies write concern options as a ``Hash``.
       Keys in the hash can be ``:w``, ``:wtimeout``, ``:j``, ``:fsync``.

     - ``Hash``
     - ``{ w: 1 }``

   * - ``:zlib_compression_level``
     - The Zlib compression level to use, if using compression. See Ruby's Zlib module for valid levels.
     - ``Integer``
     - none


URI Options
```````````

Since the URI options are required to be in camel case, which is not the Ruby
standard, the following table shows URI options and their corresponding Ruby
options.

URI options are explained in detail in the :manual:`Connection URI reference
</reference/connection-string/>`.

.. note::
  Options that are set in **milliseconds** in the URI are
  represented as a ``float`` in Ruby and the units are **seconds**.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 105

   * - URI Option
     - Ruby Option

   * - appName=String
     - ``:app_name => String``

   * - authMechanism=String
     - ``:auth_mech => Symbol``

       Auth mechanism values are converted as follows from URI options to
       Ruby options:

       - ``GSSAPI`` => ``:gssapi``
       - ``MONGODB-CR`` => ``:mongodb_cr``
       - ``MONGODB-X509`` => ``:mongodb_x509``
       - ``PLAIN`` => ``:plain``
       - ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` => ``:scram``
       - ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` => ``:scram256``

       If a different value is provided for auth mechanism, it is converted
       to the Ruby option unmodified and retains its ``String`` type.
       Note that, while currently the driver allows a ``Client`` instance
       to be constructed with an unrecognized auth mechanism, this behavior
       `may change in a future version of the driver <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/RUBY-1745>`_.

   * - authMechanismProperties=Strings
     - ``{ :auth_mech_properties => { :service_realm => String, :canonicalize_host_name => true|false, :service_name => String } }``

       Specified as comma-separated key:value pairs, e.g. ``"SERVICE_REALM:foo,CANONICALIZE_HOST_NAME:TRUE"``.

   * - authSource=String
     - ``:auth_source => String``

   * - compressors=Strings
     - ``:compressors => Array<String>``

       Specified as a comma-separated list. Note that the Ruby driver only supports zlib
       compression; however, other drivers may support snappy. For maximum compatibility with
       drivers, specify ``"snappy,zlib"``; if compatibility with other drivers is not a concern,
       specify ``"zlib".`` Compression is not enabled by default and when using MongoDB 4.0 and
       earlier, so zlib compression must be manually enabled on the server in order for the Ruby
       driver to compress wire protocol data.

   * - connect=String
     - ``:connect => Symbol``

   * - connectTimeoutMS=Integer
     - ``:connect_timeout => Float``

   * - directConnection=Boolean
     - ``:direct_connection => Boolean``

   * - fsync=Boolean
     - ``{ :write_concern => { :fsync => true|false }}``

   * - heartbeatFrequencyMS=Integer
     - ``:heartbeat_frequency => Float``

   * - journal=Boolean
     - ``{ :write_concern => { :j => true|false }}``

   * - localThresholdMS=Integer
     - ``:local_threshold => Float``

   * - maxIdleTimeMS=Integer
     - ``:max_idle_time => Float``

   * - maxStalenessSeconds=Integer
     - ``{ :read => { :max_staleness => Integer }}``

       If the maxStalenessSeconds URI option value is -1, the driver treats
       this as if the option was not given at all. Otherwise,
       if the option value is numeric, the Ruby option is set to the
       specified value converted to an ``Integer``.
       Note that numeric values greater than 0 but less than 90, or less than
       -1, are accepted by the ``Client`` constructor but will cause server
       selection to fail (unless the option is changed via, for example, the
       ``with`` method prior to any operations being performed on the driver).
       If the option value is non-numeric, it is ignored and the driver
       treats this case as if the option was not given at all.

For instance, ``"readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:1&readPreferenceTags=dc:ny"`` will be converted to ``[ { 'dc' => 'ny', 'rack' => '1' }, { 'dc' => 'ny' }]``.

Timeout Options
---------------

``server_selection_timeout``
````````````````````````````

When executing an operation, the number of seconds to wait for the driver
to find an appropriate server to send an operation to. Defaults to 30.

In replica set deployments, this timeout should be set to exceed the typical
:manual:`replica set election times </core/replica-set-elections/>`
in order for the driver to transparently handle primary changes. This timeout
also allows the application and the database to be started simultaneously;
the application will wait up to this much time for the database to become
available.

If the application server is behind a reverse proxy, server selection timeout
should be lower than the request timeout configured on the reverse proxy (for
example, this applies to deployments on Heroku which has a fixed 30 second
timeout in the routing layer). In development this value can be lowered to
provide quicker failure when the server is not running.

``socket_timeout``
``````````````````

The number of seconds to wait for a socket read or write to complete on
regular (non-monitoring) connections. Default is no timeout.

This timeout should take into account both network latency and operation
duration. For example, setting this timeout to 5 seconds will abort queries
taking more than 5 seconds to execute on the server with ``Mongo::Error::SocketTimeoutError``.

Note that even though by default there is no socket timeout set, the
operating system may still time out read operations depending on its
configuration. The keepalive settings are intended to detect broken network
connections (as opposed to aborting operations simply because they take a
long time to execute).

Note that if an operation is timed out by the driver due to exceeding the
``socket_timeout`` value, it is not aborted on the server. For this reason
it is recommended to use ``max_time_ms`` option for potentially long running
operations, as this will abort their execution on the server.

This option does not apply to monitoring connections.

``connect_timeout``
```````````````````

The number of seconds to wait for a socket connection to be established to
a server. Defaults to 10. This timeout is also used as both connect timeout
and socket timeout for monitoring connections.

``wait_queue_timeout``
``````````````````````

The number of seconds to wait for a connection in the connection pool to
become available. Defaults to 10.

As of driver version 2.11, this timeout should be set to a value at least
as large as ``connect_timeout`` because connection pool now fully establishes
connections prior to returning them, which may require several network
round trips.

``max_time_ms``
```````````````

Specified as an option on a particular operation, the number of milliseconds
to allow the operation to execute for on the server. Not set by default.

Consider using this option instead of a ``socket_timeout`` for potentially
long running operations to be interrupted on the server when they take too
long.

``wtimeout``
````````````

The number of milliseconds to wait for a write to be acknowledged by the
number of servers specified in the write concern. Not set by default, which
instructs the server to apply its default. This option can be set globally
on the client or passed to individual operations under ``:write_concern``.


TLS Connections
---------------

To connect to the MongoDB cluster using TLS, pass ``tls`` Ruby or URI option
to the ``Mongo::Client`` constructor. TLS must be explicitly configured on the
client side when the cluster requires TLS connections - there is currently no
automatic detection of whether TLS is required.

The driver will attempt to verify the server's TLS certificate by default, and
will abort the connection if this verification fails. In order for this
verification to succeed, you may need to specify the certificate authority
that the server certificate is signed with via ``tlsCAFile`` URI option or
``ssl_ca_cert`` Ruby option. If these options are not given, the driver will
use the default system root certificate store as the trust anchor; if these
options are given, the default system root certificate store will not be used.
To omit TLS certificate verification by the client, which is not
recommended, specify ``tlsInsecure=true`` URI option or ``ssl_verify: false``
Ruby option.

By default, MongoDB server will verify the connecting clients' TLS certificates,
which requires the client to specify a client certificate when connecting.
This can be accomplished through ``tlsCertificateKeyFile`` URI option which
takes as the argument the path to a single file containing both the certificate
and the corresponding private key, or through ``:ssl_cert`` and ``:ssl_key``
Ruby options. The Ruby options allow passing separace certificate and key files
to the driver, but also can be pointed at the single PEM file containing both
the certificate and the corresponding private key. Further information on
configuring MongoDB server for TLS is available in the `MongoDB manual
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/configure-ssl/>`_.

Using Intermediate Certificates
```````````````````````````````

It is possible to use certificate chains for both the client and the server
certificates. When using chains, the certificate authority parameter should
be configured to contain the trusted root certificates only; the intermediate
certificates, if any, should be provided in the server or client certificates
by concatenating them after the leaf server and client certificates, respectively.

``:ssl_cert`` and ``:ssl_cert_string`` Ruby options, as well as
``tlsCertificateKeyFile`` URI option, support certificate chains.
``:ssl_cert_object`` Ruby option, which takes an instance of
``OpenSSL::X509::Certificate``, does not support certificate chains.

The Ruby driver performs strict X.509 certificate verification, which requires
that both of the following fields are set in the intermediate certificate(s):

- X509v3 Basic Constraints: CA: TRUE -- Can sign certificates
- X509v3 Key Usage: Key Cert Sign -- Can sign certificates

More information about these flags can be found `here
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5795256/what-is-the-difference-between-the-x-509-v3-extensions-basic-constraints-and-key>`_.

It is a common pitfall to concatenate intermediate certificates to the root
CA certificates passed in ``tlsCAFile`` / ``ssl_ca_cert`` options. By doing
so, the intermediate certificates are elevated to trusted status and are
themselves not verified against the actual CA root. More information on this
issue is available `here <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/cryptography-dev/2016-August/000676.html>`_.

Specifying Multiple CA Certificates
```````````````````````````````````

``:ssl_ca_cert`` Ruby option and ``tlsCAFile`` URI option can be used with
a file containing multiple certificates. All certificates thus referenced
will become trust anchors.

``:ssl_ca_cert_object`` option takes an array of certificates, and thus
can also be used to add multiple certificates as certificate authorities.

``:ssl_ca_cert_string`` option supports passing only one CA certificate to the
driver.

Intermediate certificates should not be specified in files given to any
of these options, because they would then not be verified against actual
trusted CA certificates.


IPv4/IPv6 Connections
---------------------

When a client is constructed with ``localhost`` as the host name, it will
attempt an IPv4 connection only (i.e. if ``localhost`` resolves to
``127.0.0.1`` and ``::1``, the driver will only try to connect to
``127.0.0.1``).

When a client is constructed with hostnames other than ``localhost``, it will
attempt both IPv4 and IPv6 connections depending on the addresses that the
hostnames resolve to. The driver respects the order in which ``getaddrinfo``
returns the addresses, and will attempt to connect to them sequentially.
The first successful connection will be used.

The driver does not currently implement the Happy Eyeballs algorithm.


TCP Keepalive Configuration
---------------------------

The driver sets TCP keepalive by default. The following default values are also set if the system
value can be determined and if the driver default value is less than the system value.

- ``tcp_keepalive_time``: 300 seconds
- ``tcp_keepalive_intvl``: 10 seconds
- ``tcp_keepalive_cnt``: 9 probes


Please see the `MongoDB Diagnostics FAQ keepalive section <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-selection/server-selection.rst#serverselectiontimeoutms>`_
for instructions on setting these values at the system level.


Details on Connection Pooling
-----------------------------

``Mongo::Client`` instances have a connection pool per server that the client
is connected to. The pool creates connections on demand to support concurrent
MongoDB operations issued by the application. There is no thread-affinity
for connections.

The client instance opens one additional connection per known server
for monitoring the server's state.

The size of each connection pool is capped at ``max_pool_size``, which defaults
to 5. When a thread in the application begins an operation on MongoDB, it tries
to retrieve a connection from the pool to send that operation on. If there
are some connections available in the pool, it checks out a connection from
the pool and uses it for the operation. If there are no connections available
and the size of the pool is less than the ``max_pool_size``, a new connection
will be created. If all connections are in use and the pool has reached its
maximum size, the thread waits for a connection to be returned to the pool by
another thread.

The number of seconds the thread will wait for a connection to become available
is configurable. This setting, called ``wait_queue_timeout``, is defined in
seconds. If this timeout is reached, a ``Timeout::Error`` is raised. The
default is 1 second.

As of driver version 2.11, the driver eagerly creates connections up to
``min_pool_size`` setting. Prior to driver version 2.11, the driver always
created connections on demand. In all versions of the driver, once a connection
is established, it will be kept in the pool by the driver as long as the pool
size does not exceed ``min_pool_size``.

Note that, if ``min_pool_size`` is set to a value greater than zero, the
driver will establish that many connections to secondaries in replica set
deployments even if the application does not perform secondary reads. The
purpose of these connections is to provide faster failover when the primary
changes.

Here is an example of estimating the number of connections a multi-threaded
application will open: A client connected to a 3-node replica set opens 3
monitoring sockets. It also opens as many sockets as needed to support a
multi-threaded application's concurrent operations on each server, up to
``max_pool_size``. If the application only uses the primary (the default),
then only the primary connection pool grows and the total connections is at
most 8 (5 connections for the primary pool + 3 monitoring connections).
If the application uses a read preference to query the secondaries, their
pools also grow and the total connections can reach 18 (5 + 5 + 5 + 3).

The default configuration for a ``Mongo::Client`` works for most applications:

.. code-block:: ruby

    client = Mongo::Client.new(["localhost:27017"])

Create this client **once** for each process, and reuse it for all operations.
It is a common mistake to create a new client for each request, which is very
inefficient and not what the client was designed for.

To support extremely high numbers of concurrent MongoDB operations within one
process, increase ``max_pool_size``:

.. code-block:: ruby

    client = Mongo::Client.new(["localhost:27017"], max_pool_size: 200)

Any number of threads are allowed to wait for connections to become available,
and they can wait the default (1 second) or the ``wait_queue_timeout`` setting:

.. code-block:: ruby

    client = Mongo::Client.new(["localhost:27017"], wait_queue_timeout: 0.5)

When ``#close`` is called on a client by any thread, all connections are closed:

.. code-block:: ruby

    client.close


Usage with Forking Servers
--------------------------

*Note:* Applications using Mongoid should follow `Mongoid's forking guidance
<https://docs.mongodb.com/mongoid/current/tutorials/mongoid-configuration/#usage-with-forking-servers>`_.
The sample code below is provided for applications using the Ruby driver directly.

When using the Mongo Ruby driver with a forking web server such as Unicorn,
worker processes should generally each have their own Mongo::Client instances.
This is because:

1. The background threads remain in the parent process and are not transfered
   to the child process.
2. File descriptors like network sockets are shared between parent and
   child processes.

It is recommended to not create any Mongo::Client instances prior to the fork.
If the parent process needs to perform operations on the MongoDB database,
reset the client in an ``after_fork`` handler which is defined in
``unicorn.rb``:

.. code-block:: ruby

    after_fork do |server, worker|
      $client.close
      $client.reconnect
    end

The above code assumes your Mongo::Client instance is stored in the $client
global variable. It also keeps the MongoDB connection in the parent process
around, and this connection will continue to consume resources such as
a connection slot. If the parent process performs one time operation(s) on
MongoDB and does not need its MongoDB connection once workers are forked,
the following code will close the connection in the parent:

.. code-block:: ruby

    before_fork do |server, worker|
      $client.close
    end

    after_fork do |server, worker|
      $client.reconnect
    end

*Note:* This pattern should be used with Ruby driver version 2.6.2 or higher.
Previous driver versions did not recreate monitoring threads when reconnecting.

*Note:* If the parent process performs operations on the Mongo client and
does not close it, the parent process will continue consuming a connection slot
in the cluster and will continue monitoring the cluster for as long as the
parent remains alive.


Details on Retryable Reads
--------------------------

The driver implements two mechanisms for retrying reads: modern and legacy.
As of driver version 2.9.0, the modern mechanism is used by default, and the
legacy mechanism is deprecated.

Modern Retryable Reads
``````````````````````

When the modern mechanism is used, read operations are retried once in the
event of a network error, a "not master" error, or a "node is recovering" error.
The following operations are covered:

- `Collection#find <http://api.mongodb.com/ruby/current/Mongo/Collection.html#find-instance_method>`_
  and related methods
- `Collection#aggregate <http://api.mongodb.com/ruby/current/Mongo/Collection.html#aggregate-instance_method>`_
- `Collection#count <http://api.mongodb.com/ruby/current/Mongo/Collection.html#count-instance_method>`_,
  `Collection#count_documents <http://api.mongodb.com/ruby/current/Mongo/Collection.html#count_documents-instance_method>`_
- Change stream helpers: `Collection#watch <http://api.mongodb.com/ruby/current/Mongo/Collection.html#watch-instance_method>`_,
  `Database#watch <http://api.mongodb.com/ruby/current/Mongo/Database.html#watch-instance_method>`_,
  `Client#watch <http://api.mongodb.com/ruby/current/Mongo/Client.html#watch-instance_method>`_
- Enumeration commands: `Client#list_mongo_databases <http://api.mongodb.com/ruby/current/Mongo/Client.html#list_mongo_databases-instance_method>`_,
  `Client#list_databases <http://api.mongodb.com/ruby/current/Mongo/Client.html#list_databases-instance_method>`_,
  `Client#database_names <http://api.mongodb.com/ruby/current/Mongo/Client.html#database_names-instance_method>`_,
  `Database#collection_names <http://api.mongodb.com/ruby/current/Mongo/Database.html#collection_names-instance_method>`_,
  `Database#collections <http://api.mongodb.com/ruby/current/Mongo/Database.html#collections-instance_method>`_,
  `Database#list_collections <http://api.mongodb.com/ruby/current/Mongo/Database.html#list_collections-instance_method>`_,
  `Collection#indexes <http://api.mongodb.com/ruby/current/Mongo/Collection.html#indexes-instance_method>`_

When an operation returns a cursor, only the initial read command can be retried.
``getMore`` operations on cursors are not retried by driver version 2.9.0 or
newer. Additionally, when a read operation is retried, a new server for the
operation is selected; this may result in the retry being sent to a different
server from the one which received the first read.

The behavior of modern retryable reads is covered in detail by the
`retryable reads specification
<https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/retryable-reads/retryable-reads.rst>`_.

Note that the modern retryable reads can only be used with MongoDB 3.6 and
higher servers. When used with MongoDB 3.4 and lower servers, Ruby driver
version 2.9.0 and higher will not retry reads by default - the application
must explicitly request legacy retryable reads by setting the
``retry_reads: false`` client option or using ``retryReads=false`` URI option.

Legacy Retryable Reads
``````````````````````

The legacy read retry behavior of the Ruby driver is available by setting the
``retry_reads: false`` client option or passing the ``retryReads=false`` URI
option to the client.

When using legacy read retry behavior, the number of retries can be set
by specifying the ``max_read_retries`` client option. When using driver version
2.9.0 or higher, the set of operations which would be retried with legacy
retryable reads is identical to the one described above for modern retryable
reads. In older driver versions the behavior of legacy retryable writes was
different in that some of the operations were not retried.

As of driver version 2.9.0, legacy read retries perform server selection prior
to retrying the operation, as modern retriable writes do. In older driver
versions read retries would be sent to the same server which the initial read
was sent to.

Disabling Retryable Reads
`````````````````````````

To disable all read retries, set the following client options:
``retry_reads: false, max_read_retries: 0``.


Details on Retryable Writes
---------------------------

The driver implements two mechanisms for retrying writes: modern and legacy.
As of driver version 2.9.0, the modern mechanism is used by default on servers
that support it, and the legacy mechanism is deprecated and disabled by default
on all server versions.

The following write methods used in day-to-day operations on collections
are subject to write retries:

- ``collection#insert_one``
- ``collection#update_one``
- ``collection#delete_one``
- ``collection#replace_one``
- ``collection#find_one_and_update``
- ``collection#find_one_and_replace``
- ``collection#find_one_and_delete``
- ``collection#bulk_write`` (for all single statement ops, i.e. not for ``update_many`` or ``delete_many``)

Modern Retryable Writes
```````````````````````

The modern mechanism will retry failing writes once when the driver is
connected to a MongoDB 3.6 or higher replica set or a sharded cluster,
because they require an oplog on the serer. Modern mechanism will not retry
writes when the driver is connected to a standalone MongoDB server or
server versions 3.4 or older.

The following errors will cause writes to be retried:

- Network errors including timeouts
- "not master" errors
- "node is recovering" errors

Prior to retrying the write the driver will perform server selection,
since the server that the original write was sent to is likely no longer
usable.

Legacy Retryable Writes
```````````````````````

If modern retryable writes mechanism is disabled by setting the client
option ``retry_writes: false`` or by using the ``retryWrites=false``
URI option, the driver will utilize the legacy retryable writes mechanism.
The legacy mechanism retries writes on the same operations as the modern
mechanism. By default the legacy mechanism retries once, like the modern
mechanism does; to change the number of retries, set ``:max_write_retries``
client option.

The difference between legacy and modern retry mechanisms is that the
legacy mechanism retries writes for a different set
of errors compared to the modern mechanism, and specifically does not
retry writes when a network timeout is encountered.

Disabling Retryable Writes
``````````````````````````

To disable all write retries, set the following client options:
``retry_writes: false, max_write_retries: 0``.

Logging
-------

You can either use the default global driver logger or set your own. To set your own:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Logger.logger = other_logger

See the `Ruby Logger documentation <http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html>`_
for more information on the default logger API and available levels.

Changing the Logger Level
`````````````````````````

To change the logger level:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Logger.logger.level = Logger::WARN

For more control, a logger can be passed to a client for per-client control over logging.

.. code-block:: ruby

  my_logger = Logger.new($stdout)
  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'test', :logger => my_logger )

Truncation
``````````

The default logging truncates logs at 250 characters by default. To turn this off pass an
option to the client instance.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'test', :truncate_logs => false )


Development Configuration
-------------------------

Driver's default configuration is suitable for production deployment.
In development, some settings can be adjusted to provide a better developer
experience.

- ``:server_selection_timeout``: set this to a low value (e.g., ``1``)
  if your MongoDB server is running locally and you start it manually. A low
  server selection timeout will cause the driver to fail quickly when there is
  no server running.


Production Configuration
------------------------

Please consider the following when deploying an application using the Ruby
driver in production:

- As of driver version 2.11, the ``:min_pool_size`` client option is completely
  respected - the driver will create that many connections to each server
  identified as a standalone, primary or secondary. In previous driver versions
  the driver created connections on demand. Applications using ``:min_pool_size``
  will see an increase in the number of idle connections to all servers as of
  driver version 2.11, and especially to secondaries in replica set deployments
  and to nodes in sharded clusters.
- If the application is reverse proxied to by another web server or a load
  balancer, ``server_selection_timeout`` should generally be set to a lower
  value than the reverse proxy's read timeout. For exampe, `Heroku request timeout
  <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/request-timeout>`_ is 30 seconds and
  is not configurable; if deploying a Ruby application using MongoDB to Heroku,
  consider lowering server selection timeout to 20 or 15 seconds.
