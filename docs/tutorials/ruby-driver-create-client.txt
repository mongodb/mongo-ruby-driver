Using ``Mongo::Client``
-----------------------

To connect to a MongoDB cluster, create a ``Mongo::Client`` object.
Provide a list of hosts and options or a connection URI to the
``Mongo::Client`` constructor. The client's selected database
defaults to ``admin``.

To create a client to a standalone server, provide one host in the
seed list. Optionally, you can force the cluster topology to be
standalone without going through the auto-discovery steps.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'mydb')
  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'mydb', :connect => :direct)
  Mongo::Client.new('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mydb')

.. _ruby-driver-connect-replica-set:

To connect to a :manual:`replica set</replication/>`,
pass one or more hosts and the replica set name.
The driver's auto-discovery feature finds all members of the replica
set if they are not all provided.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017', '127.0.0.1:27018' ], :database => 'mydb', replica_set: 'myapp')
  Mongo::Client.new('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017,127.0.0.1:27018/mydb?replicaSet=myapp')

.. _ruby-driver-connect-sharded-cluster:

To create a client to a :manual:`sharded cluster</sharding/>`,
pass one or more :manual:`mongos</reference/program/mongos/>`
hosts. The auto-discovery feature can determine that the
servers are ``mongos`` instances, but if you
would like to bypass the auto-discovery, pass the
``sharded`` option to the client.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'mydb')
  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'mydb', :connect => :sharded)
  Mongo::Client.new('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mydb?connect=sharded')

The URI parser in the driver can also accept the protocol ``mongodb+srv`` as a logical
pre-processing step before it considers the connection string and other options.
In this protocol, the comma separated list of host names is replaced with a single host name. The format is:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new('mongodb+srv://test5.test.build.mongodb.cc')

.. _ruby-driver-client-options:

Client Options
--------------

A number of different options can be passed to a ``Mongo::Client`` to configure driver
behavior, either by providing them in the options hash to the constructor or by
providing them in the URI.

Since the URI options are required in camel case, which is not the Ruby standard, the
following table shows the option in the URI and its corresponding option if passed
to the constructor in Ruby.

.. note::

  The options passed directly should be symbols.

The options are explained in detail in the :manual:`Connection URI reference
</reference/connection-string/>`.

.. note::
  Options that are set in **milliseconds** in the URI are
  represented as a ``float`` in Ruby and the units are **seconds**.

URI Options Conversions

   * - URI Option
     - Ruby Option

   * - appName=String
     - ``:app_name => String``

   * - authMechanism=String
     - ``:auth_mech => Symbol``

   * - authMechanismProperties=Strings
     - ``{ :auth_mech_properties => { :service_realm => String, :canonicalize_host_name => true|false, :service_name => String } }``

       Specified as comma-separated key:value pairs, e.g. ``"SERVICE_REALM:foo,CANONICALIZE_HOST_NAME:TRUE"``.

   * - authSource=String
     - ``:auth_source => String``

   * - compressors=Strings
     - ``:compressors => Array<String>``

       Specified as a comma-separated list. Note that the Ruby driver only supports zlib
       compression; however, other drivers may support snappy. For maximum compatibility with
       drivers, specify ``"snappy,zlib"``; if compatibility with other drivers is not a concern,
       specify ``"zlib".`` Compression is not enabled by default and when using MongoDB 4.0 and
       earlier, so zlib compression must be manually enabled on the server in order for the Ruby
       driver to compress wire protocol data.

   * - connect=String
     - ``:connect => Symbol``

   * - connectTimeoutMS=Integer
     - ``:connect_timeout => Float``

   * - readPreferenceTags=Strings
     - ``{ :read => { :tag_sets => Array<Hash> }}``

       Each instance of the readPreferenceTags field is a comma-separated key:value pair which will appear in the :tag_sets array in the order they are specified. For instance, ``"readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:1&readPreferenceTags=dc:ny"`` will be converted to ``[ { 'dc' => 'ny', 'rack' => '1' }, { 'dc' => 'ny' }]``.

   * - tls=Boolean
     - ``:ssl => boolean``

   * - tlsAllowInvalidCertificates=Boolean
     - ``:ssl_verify_certificate => boolean``

       Because ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` uses ``true`` to signify that verification
       should be disabled and ``ssl_verify_certificate`` uses ``false`` to signify that
       verification should be disabled, the boolean is inverted before being used to set
       ``ssl_verify_certificate``.

   * - tlsAllowInvalidHostnames=Boolean
     - ``:ssl_verify_hostname => boolean``

       Because ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`` uses ``true`` to signify that verification
       should be disabled and ``ssl_verify_hostname`` uses ``false`` to signify that
       verification should be disabled, the boolean is inverted before being used to set
       ``ssl_verify_hostname``.

   * - tlsCAFile=String
     - ``:ssl_ca_cert => String``

   * - tlsCertificateKeyFile=String
     - ``:ssl_cert => String``

   * - tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword=String
     - ``:ssl_key_pass_phrase => String``

   * - tlsInsecure=Boolean
     - ``:ssl_verify => boolean``

       Because tlsInsecure uses ``true`` to signify that verification should be disabled and

Details on Timeout Options
--------------------------

``connect_timeout``
  On initialization of a connection to a server, this setting is the
  number of seconds to wait to connect before raising an exception.
  This timeout is also used when monitor threads ping their servers.
  The default is 10 seconds. See the `socket timeout for monitoring
  specification <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/
  master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-discovery-and-monitoring.rst#socket-timeout-for-monitoring
  -is-connecttimeoutms>`_ for further explanation.

``socket_timeout``
  The number of seconds to wait for an operation to
  execute on a socket before raising a timeout exception. It should take into
  account network latency and operation duration. The default is no value; the default is effectively infinity.
  Please consider using ``max_time_ms`` per-operation instead, as the ``socket_timeout`` does not stop the operation
  on the server; a long-running operation will continue to run on the server, beyond a socket timeout being reached.
  See the `socket timeout for monitoring specification <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-discovery-and-monitoring.rst#socket-timeout-for-monitoring-is-connecttimeoutms>`_
  documentation for further information relating to server discovery and monitoring.

``server_selection_timeout``
  The number of seconds to wait for the driver to find an appropriate server to
  which an operation can be sent before raising an exception. Defaults to 30.
  It should take the speed of :manual:`elections</core/replica-set-elections/>`
  during a failover into account. See the
  `serverSelectionTimeoutMS specification
  <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-selection/server-selection.rst#serverselectiontimeoutms>`_
  for further information.

``local_threshold``
  The maximum latency in seconds between the nearest server and the servers that can be considered available to send an
  operation to. Defaults to 0.015.

.. note::
  This is not the latency window between the driver and a server, but
  rather the latency between the nearest server and other servers. See
  `the localThresholdMS specification
  <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-selection/server-selection.rst#localthresholdms>`_.

``wait_queue_timeout``
  The number of seconds to wait for a connection in the connection pool to
  become available. You should consider increasing this
  number if you are seeing many ``Timeout`` errors while using many threads
  or when operations are long-running. Defaults to 1 second.

``max_time_ms``
  Specified as an option on a particular operation. It defines a cumulative time limit in milliseconds for processing
  operations on a cursor. Consider using this option instead of a ``socket_timeout``, if the operation should be
  interrupted on the server. See the
  `CRUD specification <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/crud/crud.rst>`_ for details on
  operations that support this option.


TCP Keepalive Configuration
---------------------------

The driver sets TCP keepalive by default. The following default values are also set if the system
value can be determined and if the driver default value is less than the system value.

- ``tcp_keepalive_time``: 300 seconds
- ``tcp_keepalive_intvl``: 10 seconds
- ``tcp_keepalive_cnt``: 9 probes


Please see the `MongoDB Diagnostics FAQ keepalive section <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-selection/server-selection.rst#serverselectiontimeoutms>`_
for instructions on setting these values at the system level.


Details on Connection Pooling
-----------------------------

``Mongo::Client`` instances have a connection pool per server that the client
is connected to. The pool creates connections on demand to support concurrent
MongoDB operations issued by the application. There is no thread-affinity
for connections.

The client instance opens one additional connection per known server
for monitoring the server's state.

The size of each connection pool is capped at ``max_pool_size``, which defaults
to 5. When a thread in the application begins an operation on MongoDB, it tries
to retrieve a connection from the pool to send that operation on. If there
are some connections available in the pool, it checks out a connection from
the pool and uses it for the operation. If there are no connections available
and the size of the pool is less than the ``max_pool_size``, a new connection
will be created. If all connections are in use and the pool has reached its
maximum size, the thread waits for a connection to be returned to the pool by
another thread.

The number of seconds the thread will wait for a connection to become available
is configurable. This setting, called ``wait_queue_timeout``, is defined in
seconds. If this timeout is reached, a ``Timeout::Error`` is raised. The
default is 1 second.

The driver currently does not eagerly create connections, regardless of
``min_pool_size`` setting. However, once a connection is established, it will
be kept in the pool by the driver as long as the pool size does not exceed
``min_pool_size``.

Here is an example of estimating the number of connections a multi-threaded
application will open: A client connected to a 3-node replica set opens 3
monitoring sockets. It also opens as many sockets as needed to support a
multi-threaded application's concurrent operations on each server, up to
``max_pool_size``. If the application only uses the primary (the default),
then only the primary connection pool grows and the total connections is at
most 8 (5 connections for the primary pool + 3 monitoring connections).
If the application uses a read preference to query the secondaries, their
pools also grow and the total connections can reach 18 (5 + 5 + 5 + 3).

The default configuration for a ``Mongo::Client`` works for most applications:

.. code-block:: ruby

    client = Mongo::Client.new(["localhost:27017"])

Create this client **once** for each process, and reuse it for all operations.
It is a common mistake to create a new client for each request, which is very
inefficient and not what the client was designed for.

To support extremely high numbers of concurrent MongoDB operations within one
process, increase ``max_pool_size``:

.. code-block:: ruby

    client = Mongo::Client.new(["localhost:27017"], max_pool_size: 200)

Any number of threads are allowed to wait for connections to become available,
and they can wait the default (1 second) or the ``wait_queue_timeout`` setting:

.. code-block:: ruby

    client = Mongo::Client.new(["localhost:27017"], wait_queue_timeout: 0.5)

When ``#close`` is called on a client by any thread, all connections are closed:

.. code-block:: ruby

    client.close


Usage with Forking Servers
--------------------------

When using the Mongo Ruby driver with a forking web server such as Unicorn,
worker processes should generally each have their own Mongo::Client instances.
This is because:

1. The background threads remain in the parent process and are not transfered
   to the child process.
2. File descriptors like network sockets are shared between parent and
   child processes.

It is recommended to not create any Mongo::Client instances prior to the fork.
If the parent process needs to perform operations on the MongoDB database,
reset the client in an ``after_fork`` handler which is defined in
``unicorn.rb``:

.. code-block:: ruby

    after_fork do |server, worker|
      $client.close
      $client.reconnect
    end

The above code assumes your Mongo::Client instance is stored in the $client
global variable. It also keeps the MongoDB connection in the parent process
around, and this connection will continue to consume resources such as
a connection slot. If the parent process performs one time operation(s) on
MongoDB and does not need its MongoDB connection once workers are forked,
the following code will close the connection in the parent:

.. code-block:: ruby

    before_fork do |server, worker|
      $client.close
    end

    after_fork do |server, worker|
      $client.reconnect
    end

*Note:* This pattern should be used with Ruby driver version 2.6.2 or higher.
Previous driver versions did not recreate monitoring threads when reconnecting.

*Note:* If the parent process performs operations on the Mongo client and
does not close it, the parent process will continue consuming a connection slot
in the cluster and will continue monitoring the cluster for as long as the
parent remains alive.

Details on Retryable Writes
---------------------------

The driver implements two mechanisms for retrying writes: modern and legacy.
As of driver version 2.9.0, the modern mechanism is used by default, and the
legacy mechanism is deprecated.

The following write methods used in day-to-day operations on collections
are subject to write retries:

- ``collection#insert_one``
- ``collection#update_one``
- ``collection#delete_one``
- ``collection#replace_one``
- ``collection#find_one_and_update``
- ``collection#find_one_and_replace``
- ``collection#find_one_and_delete``
- ``collection#bulk_write`` (for all single statement ops, i.e. not for ``update_many`` or ``delete_many``)

Modern Retryable Writes
```````````````````````

The modern mechanism will retry failing writes once when the driver is
connected to a MongoDB 3.6 or higher replica set or a sharded cluster,
because they require an oplog on the serer. Modern mechanism will not retry
writes when the driver is connected to a standalone MongoDB server or
server versions 3.4 or older.

The following errors will cause writes to be retried:

- Network errors including timeouts
- "not master" errors
- "node is recovering" errors

Prior to retrying the write the driver will perform server selection,
since the server that the original write was sent to is likely no longer
usable.

Legacy Retryable Writes
```````````````````````

If modern retryable writes mechanism is disabled by setting the client
option ``retry_writes: false`` or by using the ``retryWrites=false``
URI option, the driver will utilize the legacy retryable writes mechanism.
The legacy mechanism retries writes on the same operations as the modern
mechanism, and retries one time as the modern mechanism does.
The difference is that legacy mechanism retries writes for a different set
of errors compared to the modern mechanism, and specifically does not
retry writes when a network timeout is encountered.

Disabling Retryable Writes
``````````````````````````

Currently the driver will always retry writes on transient server-related
errors like "not master" and "node is recovering". A future version of
the driver may provide a mechanism to disable write retries entirely.

Logging
-------

You can either use the default global driver logger or set your own. To set your own:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Logger.logger = other_logger

See the `Ruby Logger documentation <http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html>`_
for more information on the default logger API and available levels.

Changing the Logger Level
`````````````````````````

To change the logger level:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Logger.logger.level = Logger::WARN

For more control, a logger can be passed to a client for per-client control over logging.

.. code-block:: ruby

  my_logger = Logger.new($stdout)
  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'test', :logger => my_logger )

Truncation
``````````

The default logging truncates logs at 250 characters by default. To turn this off pass an
option to the client instance.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'test', :truncate_logs => false )


Development Configuration
-------------------------

Driver's default configuration is suitable for production deployment.
In development, some settings can be adjusted to provide a better developer
experience.

- ``:server_selection_timeout``: set this to a low value (e.g., ``1``)
  if your MongoDB server is running locally and you start it manually. A low
  server selection timeout will cause the driver to fail quickly when there is
  no server running.


Production Configuration
------------------------

Please consider the following when deploying an application using the Ruby
driver in production:

- The driver has a setting for minimum connection pool size.
  This setting results in the driver creating the specified number of
  connection objects but each connection object creates sockets and
  actually connects to the server on demand. Setting a minimum connection
  pool size will keep up to that many network connections to a server
  alive once they are established. This behavior may change in a future
  version of the driver (`RUBY-1605 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/RUBY-1605>`_).
