The following compatibility table specifies the recommended
version(s) of the MongoDB Ruby driver for use with a specific version of
MongoDB. Except when indicated, the specified driver versions expose or
take advantage of the features added in the corresponding server versions.

MongoDB server releases are generally backwards compatible, meaning a
particular version of the driver will generally work with newer versions of
the server but may not take advantage of the functionality released in the
newer version of the server.

The first column lists the driver versions.
