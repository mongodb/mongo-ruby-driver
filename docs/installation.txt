Please consult the `releases page on GitHub
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/releases>`_ for the list
of improvements and changes in each version of the driver.


TLS/SSL and the Ruby Driver
---------------------------

Industry best practices, and some regulations, require the use of TLS 1.1 or newer. Though no application changes are
required for the Ruby driver to make use of the newest protocols, some operating systems or versions may not provide
an OpenSSL version new enough to support them.

Users of macOS older than 10.13 (High Sierra) will need to install Ruby from `rvm`_, `homebrew`_, `macports`_, or
another similar source. See `installation information on ruby-lang.org`_ for more options.

Users of Linux or other non-macOS Unix can check their OpenSSL version like this:

.. code-block:: sh

  $ openssl version

If the version number is less than 1.0.1 support for TLS 1.1 or newer is not available. Contact your operating system
vendor for a solution or upgrade to a newer distribution.

You can check your Ruby interpreter by executing the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

  ruby -e "require 'net/http'; require 'json'; puts JSON.parse(Net::HTTP.get(URI('https://www.howsmyssl.com/a/check')))['tls_version']"

You should see "TLS 1.X" where X is >= 1.
