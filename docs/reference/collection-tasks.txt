MongoDB stores documents in collections. If a collection does not
exist, MongoDB creates the collection when you first insert a
document in that collection.

You can also explicitly create a collection with various options,
such as setting the maximum size or the documentation validation rules.

Capped Collections
``````````````````

Capped collections have maximum size or document counts that prevent
them from growing beyond maximum thresholds. All capped collections must
specify a maximum size and may also specify a maximum document count.
MongoDB removes older documents if a collection reaches the maximum size
limit before it reaches the maximum document count.

To create a :manual:`capped collection</core/capped-collections/>`, use
the ``capped: true`` option along with a ``size`` in bytes.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  collection = client[:artists, capped: true, size: 10000]
  collection.create
  collection.capped? # => true

Convert an Existing Collection to Capped
````````````````````````````````````````

To convert an existing collection from non-capped to capped, use
the ``convertToCapped`` command.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  db = client.database
  db.command({ 'convertToCapped' => 'artists', 'size' => 10000 })


Document Validation
```````````````````

If you're using MongoDB version 3.2 or later, you can use
:manual:`document validation</core/document-validation/>`.
Collections with validations compare each inserted or updated
document against the criteria specified in the validator option.
Depending on the ``validationLevel`` and ``validationAction``, MongoDB
either returns a warning, or refuses to insert or update the document
if it fails to meet the specified criteria.

The following example creates a ``contacts`` collection with a validator
that specifies that inserted or updated documents should match at
least one of three following conditions:

- the ``phone`` field is a string
- the ``email`` field matches the regular expression
- the ``status`` field is either ``Unknown`` or ``Incomplete``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'test')
  client[:contacts, 

      {
         'validator' => { '$or' =>
            [
               { 'phone' => { '$type' => "string" } },
               { 'email' => { '$regex' => /@mongodb\.com$/ } },
               { 'status' => { '$in' => [ "Unknown", "Incomplete" ] } }
            ]
         }
      }

    ].create

Add Validation to an Existing Collection
````````````````````````````````````````

To add document validation criteria to an existing collection, use the
``collMod`` command. The example below demonstrates how to add a
validation to the ``contacts`` collection, ensuring that all new
documents must contain an ``age`` field which is a number.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'test')
  db = client.database
  db.command({ 'collMod' => 'contacts',
               'validator' =>
                 { 'age' =>
                   { '$type' => "number" }
                 }
             })

Listing Collections
```````````````````

Use ``collections`` or ``collection_names`` methods on a database
objects to list collections:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  database = client.database

  database.collections      # Returns an array of Collection objects.
  database.collection_names # Returns an array of collection names as strings.

Dropping Collections
````````````````````

To drop a collection, call ``drop`` on the collection object.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Mongo::Client.new([ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'music')
  artists = client[:artists]
  artists.drop
