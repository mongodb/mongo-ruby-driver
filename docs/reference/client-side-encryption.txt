New in MongoDB 4.2, client-side encryption allows administrators and developers
to encrypt specific fields in MongoDB documents before inserting them into the
database.

With client-side encryption, developers can encrypt fields client-side without
any server-side configuration or directives. Client-side encryption supports
workloads where applications must guarantee that unauthorized parties,
including server administrators, cannot read the encrypted data.

.. warning::

  Enabling Client Side Encryption reduces the maximum write batch size and may
  have a negative performance impact.

Installation
============

Client-side encryption requires the installation of additional packages.

libmongocrypt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libmongocrypt is a C library used by the driver for client-side encryption.
To use client-side encryption, you must install the libmongocrypt binary
on the machine running your Ruby program.

To download a pre-built binary:

- Download a tarball of all libmongocrypt variations `here <https://s3.amazonaws.com/mciuploads/libmongocrypt/all/master/latest/libmongocrypt-all.tar.gz>`_.

- Extract the file you downloaded. You will see a list of directories, each
  corresponding to an operating system. Find the directory that matches your
  operating system and open it.

- Inside that folder, open the folder called "nocrypto." In either the
  lib or lb64 folder, you will find the libmongocrypt.so or
  libmongocrypt.dylib or libmongocrypt.dll file, depending on your OS.

- Move that file to wherever you want to keep it on your machine. You may delete
  the other files included in the tarball.

To build the binary from source:

- Follow the instructions in the README in the `libmongocrypt GitHub repo <https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt>`_.

Once you have the libmongocrypt binary on your machine, specify the path to the
binary using the LIBMONGOCRYPT_PATH environment variable. It is recommended that
you add this variable to your rc files. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

  export LIBMONGOCRYPT_PATH=/path/to/your/libmongocrypt.so

mongocryptd
~~~~~~~~~~~

Mongocryptd is a daemon that tells the driver which fields to encrypt in a
given operation. It is only required for automatic encryption, which is an
enterprise-only feature. If you only intend to use explicit encryption, you may
skip this step.

Mongocryptd comes pre-packaged with enterprise builds of the MongoDB server
(versions 4.2 and newer). For installation instructions, see
`the MongoDB manual <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/security-client-side-encryption-appendix/#installation>`_.

In order to configure mongocryptd (for example, which port it listens on or the
path used to spawn the daemon), it is necessary to pass different options to the
``Mongo::Client`` performing automatic encryption. See the `:extra_options`_
section of this tutorial for more information.

Automatic Encryption
====================

Automatic encryption is a feature that allows users to configure a
``Mongo::Client`` instance to always encrypt specific document fields when
performing database operations. Once the ``Mongo::Client`` is configured, it
will automatically encrypt any field that requires encryption before writing
it to the database, and it will automatically decrypt those fields when reading
them.

Client-side encryption implements envelope encryption, which is the practice of
encrypting data with a data key, which is in turn encrypted using a master key.
Thus, using client-side encryption with MongoDB involves three main steps:

1. Create a master key
2. Create a data key (and encrypt it using the master key)
3. Encrypt data using the data key

The example below demonstrates how to follow these steps with a local master key
in order to perform automatic encryption.

.. note::

  Automatic encryption is an enterprise only feature that only applies to
  operations on a collection. Automatic encryption is not supported for operations
  on a database or view, and operations that are not bypassed will result in
  error (see `Auto Encryption Whitelist <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/client-side-encryption/client-side-encryption.rst#libmongocrypt-auto-encryption-whitelist>`_
  ). To bypass automatic encryption for all operations, set ``bypass_auto_encryption``
  to true in ``auto_encryption_options``.

.. note::

  Automatic encryption requires the authenticated user to have the listCollections privilege action.

Explicit Encryption
===================
Explicit encryption is a feature that allows users to encrypt and decrypt
individual pieces of data such as strings, integers, or symbols. Explicit
encryption is a community feature and does not require an enterprise build
of the MongoDB server to use. To perform all explicit encryption and decryption
operations, use an instance of the ClientEncryption class.

Client-side encryption implements envelope encryption, which is the practice of
encrypting data with a data key, which is in turn encrypted using a master key.
Thus, using client-side encryption with MongoDB involves three main steps:

1. Create a master key
2. Create a data key (and encrypt it using the master key)
3. Encrypt data using the data key

The example below demonstrates how to follow these steps with a local master key

  client = Mongo::Client.new(['localhost:27017'])
  collection = client.use('encryption_db')['encryption_coll']
  collection.drop # Make sure there is no data in the collection

  # Insert the encrypted value into the collection
  collection.insert_one(encrypted_field: encrypted_value)

  # Use the client to read the encrypted value from the database, then
  # use the ClientEncryption object to decrypt it
  find_result = collection.find(encrypted_field: encrypted_value).first['encrypted_field']
  # => <BSON::Binary...> (the find result is encrypted)

  unencrypted_result = client_encryption.decrypt(find_result)
  # => "sensitive data"

The example above demonstrates using explicit encryption with a local master key.
For more information about using the AWS Key Management Service to create a
master key and create data keys, see the following sections of this tutorial:

- `Creating A Master Key`_,
- `Creating A Data Key`_,

Creating a Master Key
=====================
Both automatic encryption and explicit encryption require an encryption master key.
This master key is used to encrypt data keys, which are in turn used to encrypt
user data. The master key can be generated in one of two ways: by creating a
local key, or by creating a key in the Amazon Web Services Key Management
Service (AWS KMS).

Local Master Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A local master key is a 96-byte binary string. It should be persisted
on your machine as an environment variable or in a text file.

.. warning::

  Using a local master key is insecure and not recommended if you plan
  to use client-side encryption in production.

Run the following code to generate a local master key using Ruby:

.. code-block:: ruby

  local_master_key = SecureRandom.random_bytes(96)
  # => "\xB2\xBE\x8EN\xD4\x14\xC2\x13\xC3..." (a binary blob)

AWS Master Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is recommended that you use Amazon's Key Management Service to create and
store your master key. To do so, follow steps 1 and 2 of the
:manual:`"Convert to a Remote Master Key" section</ecosystem/use-cases/client-side-field-level-encryption-local-key-to-kms/#convert-to-a-remote-master-key>`
in the MongoDB Client-Side Encryption documentation.

For more information about creating a master key, see the
:manual:`Create a Master Key </ecosystem/use-cases/client-side-field-level-encryption-guide/#a-create-a-master-key>`
section of the MongoDB manual.

Creating a Data Key
===================
Once you have created a master key, create a data key by calling the
``#create_data_key`` method on an instance of the ``Mongo::ClientEncryption``
class. This method generates a new data key and inserts it into the key vault
collection, which is the MongoDB collection in which you choose to store your
data keys. The ``#create_data_key`` method returns id of the newly-created
data key in the form of a BSON::Binary object.

Create a Data Key Using a Local Master Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have created a local master key, you may use it to generate a new data
key with the following code snippet:

.. warning::

  Using a local master key is insecure and not recommended if you plan
  to use client-side encryption in production.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # A Mongo::Client instance that will be used to connect to the key vault
  # collection. Replace the server address with the address of the MongoDB
  # server where you would like to store your key vault collection.
  key_vault_client = Mongo::Client.new(['localhost:27017'])

  client_encryption = Mongo::ClientEncryption.new(
    key_vault_client,
    # Replace with the database and collection names for your key vault collection
    key_vault_namespace: 'admin.datakeys',
    kms_providers: {
      local: {
        key: local_master_key
      }
    }
  )

  data_key_id = client_encryption.create_data_key('local')
  # => <BSON::Binary... type=ciphertext...>

See the `Local Master Key`_ section for more information about generating a new
local master key.

Create a Data Key Using an AWS Master Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have created an AWS master key, note the access key ID and the secret access
key of the IAM user that has permissions to use the key. Additionally, note
the AWS region and the Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of your master key. You will
use that information to generate a data key.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # A Mongo::Client instance that will be used to connect to the key vault
  # collection. Replace the server address with the address of the MongoDB
  # server where you would like to store your key vault collection.
  key_vault_client = Mongo::Client.new(['localhost:27017'])

  client_encryption = Mongo::ClientEncryption.new(
    key_vault_client,
    # Replace with the database and collection names for your key vault collection
    key_vault_namespace: 'admin.datakeys',
    kms_providers: {
      aws: {
        access_key_id: 'IAM-ACCESS-KEY-ID',
        secret_access_key: 'IAM-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY'
      }
    }
  )

  data_key_id = client_encryption.create_data_key(
    'aws',
    {
      master_key: {
        region: 'REGION-OF-YOUR-MASTER-KEY',
        key: 'ARN-OF-YOUR-MASTER-KEY'
      }

    }
  )
  # => <BSON::Binary... type=ciphertext...>

See the `AWS Master Key`_ section of this tutorial  for more information about
generating a new master key on AWS and finding the information you need to
create data keys.

For more information about creating a data key, see the
:manual:`Create a Data Encryption Key </ecosystem/use-cases/client-side-field-level-encryption-guide/#b-create-a-data-encryption-key>`
section of the MongoDB manual.

Auto-Encryption Options
=======================
Automatic encryption can be configured on a ``Mongo::Client`` using the
``auto_encryption_options`` option ``Hash``. This section provides an overview
of the fields inside ``auto_encryption_options`` and explains how to choose their
values.

``:key_vault_client``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The key vault client is a ``Mongo::Client`` instance that will be used to connect
to the MongoDB collection containing your encryption data keys. For example, if
your key vault was hosted on a MongoDB instance at ``localhost:30000``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  key_vault_client = Mongo::Client.new(['localhost:30000'])

  Mongo::Client.new(['localhost:27017],
    auto_encryption_options: {
      key_vault_client: key_vault_client,
      # ... (Fill in other options here)
    }
  )

If your data keys are stored in the same MongoDB instance that stores your encrypted
data, you may leave this option blank, and the top-level client will be used
to insert and fetch data keys.

``:key_vault_namespace``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The key vault namespace is a ``String`` in the format ``"database_name.collection_name"``,
where ``database_name`` and ``collection_name`` are the name of the database and
collection in which you would like to store your data keys. For example, if your data
keys are stored in the ``admin`` database in the ``datakeys`` collection:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new(['localhost:27017],
    auto_encryption_options: {
      key_vault_namespace: 'admin.datakeys',
      # ... (Fill in other options here)
    }
  )

There is no default key vault namespace, and this option must be provided.

``:schema_map``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A schema map is a Hash with information about which fields to automatically
encrypt and decrypt.

The code snippet at the top of this tutorial demonstrates creating a schema
map using a Ruby ``Hash``. While this will work, schema maps can grow quite
large and it could be unweildy to include them in your Ruby code. Instead, it is
recommended that you store them in a separate JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
file.

Before creating the JSON file, Base64-encode the UUID of the your data key.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Base64.encode64(data_key_id.data)
  # => "sr6OTtQUwhPD..." (a base64-encoded string)

Then, create a new JSON file containing your schema map in the format defined by
the JSON Schema Draft 4 standard syntax. You can read more about formatting
your schema map in the :manual:`Automatic Encryption Rules</reference/security-client-side-automatic-json-schema/>`
section of the MongoDB manual.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "encryption_db.encryption_coll": {
      "properties": {
        "encrypted_field": {
          "encrypt": {
            "keyId": [{
              "$binary": {
                "base64": "YOUR-BASE64-ENCODED-DATA-KEY-ID",
                "subType": "04"
              }
            }],
            "bsonType": "string",
            "algorithm": "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic"
          }
        }
      },
      "bsonType": "object"
    }
  }

When you intend to use your schema map, convert it to a Ruby ``Hash`` using the
``BSON::ExtJSON`` module in the ``bson`` Ruby gem.

.. code-block:: ruby

  schema_map = BSON::ExtJSON.parse(File.read('/path/to/your/file.json'))
  # => { 'encryption_db.encryption_coll' => { ... } }

  Mongo::Client.new(['localhost:27017],
    auto_encryption_options: {
      schema_map: schema_map,
      # ... (Fill in other options here)
    }
  )

.. note::

  It is also possible to supply a schema map as a validator on a MongoDB collection.
  This is referred to as a "remote schema map," while providing the schema map as
  an option on the ``Mongo::Client`` is called a "local schema map."

  Supplying a local schema map provides more security than relying on JSON schemas
  obtained from the server. It protects against a malicious server advertising
  a false JSON schema, which could trick the client into sending unencrypted
  data that should be encrypted.

  See :manual:`Server-Side Field Level Encryption Enforcement</core/security-automatic-client-side-encryption/#server-side-field-level-encryption-enforcement>`
  in the MongoDB manual for more information about using the schema map to
  create a JSON schema validator on your collection.

.. seealso::

  :manual:`Specify Encrypted Fields Using JSON Schema</ecosystem/use-cases/client-side-field-level-encryption-guide/#c-specify-encrypted-fields-using-json-schema>`,
  :manual:`Automatic Encryption Rules</reference/security-client-side-automatic-json-schema/>`

``:bypass_auto_encryption``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``:bypass_auto_encryption`` option is a ``Boolean`` that specifies whether the
``Mongo::Client`` should skip encryption when writing to the database. If
``:bypass_auto_encryption`` is ``true``, the client will still perform automatic
decryption of any previously-encrypted data.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Client.new(['localhost:27017],
    auto_encryption_options: {
      bypass_auto_encryption: true,
      # ... (Fill in other options here)
    }
  )

``:extra_options``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``:extra_options`` is a ``Hash`` of options related to spawning mongocryptd.
Every option in this ``Hash`` has a default value, so it is only necessary to
provide the options whose defaults you want to override.

- ``:mongocryptd_spawn_args`` - This is an ``Array<String>`` containing arguments
  for spawning mongocryptd. The Ruby driver will pass these arguments to
  mongocryptd on spawning the daemon. Possible arguments are:

  - ``"--idleShutdownTimeoutSecs"`` - The number of seconds mongocryptd must remain
    idle before it shuts itself down. The default value is 60.
  - ``"--port"`` - The port at which mongocryptd will listen for connections. The
    default is 27020.

- ``:mongocryptd_uri`` - The URI that the driver will use to connect to mongocryptd.
  By default, this is ``"mongodb://localhost:27020"``.

- ``:mongocryptd_spawn_path`` - The path to the mongocryptd executable. The default
  is ``"mongocryptd"``.

- ``:mongocryptd_bypass_spawn`` - A ``Boolean`` indicating whether the driver should
  skip spawning mongocryptd.

For example, if you would like to run mongocryptd on port 30000, provide
``extra_options`` as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Mongo::Client.new(['localhost:27017],
    auto_encryption_options: {
      extra_options: {
        mongocryptd_spawn_args: ['--port=30000'],
        mongocryptd_uri: 'mongodb://localhost:30000',
      }
      # ... (Fill in other options here)
    }
  )

.. warning::

  The contents of ``:extra_options`` is subject to change in future versions
  of the client-side encryption API.
