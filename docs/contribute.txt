Report Bugs and Request Ruby Driver-Specific Features
=====================================================

To report a bug in the driver or request a feature specific to the Ruby driver:

1. Visit `our issue tracker <https://jira.mongodb.org/>`_ and login
   (or create an account if you do not have one already).
2. Navigate to the `RUBY project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/RUBY>`_.
3. Click :guilabel:`Create Issue` and fill out all of the applicable form
   fields.

When creating an issue, please keep in mind that all information in JIRA
for the RUBY project, as well as the core server (the SERVER project),
is publicly visible.

**PLEASE DO:**

- Provide as much information as possible about the issue.
- Provide detailed steps for reproducing the issue.
- Provide any applicable code snippets, stack traces and log data.
  Do not include any sensitive data or server logs.
- Specify version numbers of the driver and MongoDB server.

**PLEASE DO NOT:**

- Provide any sensitive data or server logs.
- Report potential security issues publicly (see 'Security Issues' below).

.. note::

   Bug reports in JIRA for the Ruby driver and the core server (the **SERVER**)
   projects are public.

If you identified a potential security vulnerability in the Ruby driver or
any other MongoDB product, please report it according to the instructions found
in the :manual:`Create a Vulnerability Report
</tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report>`.


Request Product Features
========================

To request a feature which is not specific to the Ruby driver, or which
affects more than the driver alone (for example, a feature which requires
MongoDB server support), please submit your idea through the
`MongoDB Feedback Forum <https://feedback.mongodb.com/forums/924286-drivers>`_.


Contribute Code
===============

The MongoDB Ruby driver source is located
`at GitHub <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver>`_.

The list of known issues in the driver is available 
`in JIRA <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/RUBY>`_.

We recommend creating a JIRA ticket before starting work on a bug fix or
an improvement to the driver, to obtain feedback from the Ruby driver team
as to the proposed changes. A JIRA ticket is not required to submit
a pull request but it is appreciated, especially for non-trivial changes.

Pull requests should be made against the ``master`` branch and
include relevant tests, if applicable. The Ruby driver team will backport
the changes to the stable branches, if needed.

A MongoDB deployment is required to run the tests. Setup procedures and
recommendations for various deployments, as well as how to configure the
driver's test suite for the deployments, are covered in the `spec
readme <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/blob/master/spec/README.md>`.

The driver is tested on `Evergreen <https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen>`_,
MongoDB's in-house continuous integration platform. After a pull request
is created, one of the Ruby driver team engineers will schedule an Evergreen
build.
