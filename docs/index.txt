Ruby MongoDB Driver
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The MongoDB Ruby driver is the officially supported Ruby driver for
MongoDB. It is written in pure Ruby and is optimized for simplicity. It
can be used on its own, but it also serves as the basis of several
object mapping libraries.

Get Started
-----------

To get started with the Ruby driver, see :doc:`/installation` and
:doc:`/quick-start`.

BSON
----

The Ruby BSON implementation is packaged in a separate gem with C and
Java extensions for speed depending on the runtime enviroment.

For reference on the Ruby BSON gem, see :doc:`/bson-tutorials`.

Object Mappers
--------------

Because MongoDB is so easy to use, the basic Ruby driver can be the
best solution for many applications. But if you need validations,
associations, and other high-level data modeling functions, then you
may need Object Document Mapper may be needed.

In the context of a Rails application, an Object Document Mapper
provides functionality equivalent to, but distinct from, ActiveRecord.
Because MongoDB is a document-based database, these mappers are called
Object Document Mappers (ODM) as opposed to Object Relational Mappers
(ORM).

The ODM officially supported by MongoDB is Mongoid, originally written
by Durran Jordan.

For tutorials on Mongoid, see :doc:`/mongoid-tutorials`.

.. COMMENT  For the actual build, see mongodb/docs-ruby repo which pulls the documentation source from:
..    mongo-ruby-driver, 
..    bson-ruby, and 
..    mongoid repos.
