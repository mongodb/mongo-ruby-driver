Mongoid includes ``ActiveModel::Validations`` to supply the basic
validation plus an additional associated and uniqueness validator.

See the `ActiveModel::Validations
<http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activemodel/lib/active_model/validations.rb>`_ 
documentation for more information.

Mongoid behaves slightly different to Active Record when using ``#valid?``
on already persisted data. Active Record's ``#valid?`` will run all
validations whereas Mongoid's ``#valid?`` will only run validations on
documents that are in memory as an optimization.
