Nested Attributes
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Nested attributes provide a mechanism for updating documents and their
relations in a single operation by nesting attributes in a single
parameters hash. This is useful when wanting to edit multiple documents
within a single web form.

Behavior
--------

Nested attributes can be enabled for any relation, embedded or referenced. To enable this
for the relation, simply provide the relation name to the ``accepts_nested_attributes_for`` macro.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_many :albums
     belongs_to :producer
     accepts_nested_attributes_for :albums, :producer
   end

Note that when you add nested attributes functionality to a referenced relation, Mongoid
will automatically enable autosave for that relation.

When a relation gains nested attributes behavior, an additional method is added to the base
model, which should be used to update the attributes with the new functionality. This method
is the relation name plus ``_attributes=``. You can use this method directly, or more commonly
the name of the method can be an attribute in the updates for the base class, in which case
Mongoid will call the appropriate setter under the covers.

.. code-block:: ruby

   band = Band.first
   band.producer_attributes = { name: "Flood" }
   band.attributes = { producer_attributes: { name: "Flood" }}

Note that this will work with any attribute based setter method in Mongoid. This includes:
``update_attributes``, ``update_attributes!`` and ``attributes=``.
