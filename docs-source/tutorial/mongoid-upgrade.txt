Upgrade Mongoid
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Upgrade to 5.x Series
`````````````````````

The underlying driver has changed from Moped to the official MongoDB Ruby driver.
For all users dropping down to the driver level for operations, please see the driver
documentation for help with that API.

All Mongoid configuration options have changed, as the underlying driver has changed
from Moped to the core MongoDB Ruby driver. Please see the
:ref:`configuration section <mongoid-configuration>` for a detailed description of all new options.

All references to session are now replaced with client. This includes the ``mongoid.yml``
configuration, ``store_in`` options, and all exceptions and modules with Session in the name.

``find_and_modify`` has been removed and replaced with 3 options: ``find_one_and_update``,
``find_one_and_delete`` and ``find_one_and_replace``.

``text_search`` has been removed as it is now a $text option in a query from 2.6 on.

Mongoid no longer supports MongoDB 2.2 - support is now for only 2.4 and higher.

``first`` and ``last`` no longer add an ``_id`` sort when no sorting options have been
provided. In order to guarantee that a document is the first or last, it needs to now
contain an explicit sort.
