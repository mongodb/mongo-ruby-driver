# There is an undocumented {replSetStepUp: 1} command which can be used to
# ask a particular secondary to become a primary. It has existed since server
# 3.6 or earlier.
#
# Alternatively, to encourage a specific server to be selected, the recommended
# way is to set priority of that server higher. Changing priority requires
# reconfiguring the replica set, which in turn requires the replica set to
# have a primary.
#
# There are three timeouts that affect elections and stepdowns, when asking a
# server to step down:
#
# - secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs - how long the existing primary will wait for
#   secondaries to catch up prior to actually stepping down.
# - replSetStepDown parameter - how long the existing primary will decline
#   getting elected as the new primary.
# - electionTimeoutMillis - how long, after a server notices that there is
#   no primary, that server will vote or call elections.
#
# These parameters must be configured in a certain way;
#
# - replSetStepDown should generally be higher than secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs.
#   If a server is asked to step down and it spends all of its replSetStepDown
#   time waiting for secondaries to catch up, the stepdown itself will not
#   be performed and an error will be returned for the stepdown command.
# - secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs + electionTimeoutMillis should be lower than
#   replSetStepDown, so that all of the other servers can participate in
#   the election prior to the primary which is stepping down becoming eligible
#   to vote and potentially getting reelected.
#
# Settings used by this test:
#
# - replSetStepDown = 4 seconds
# - secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs = 2 seconds
# - electionTimeoutMillis = 1 second
#
# Recommended guidance for working elections:
# - Set priority of all nodes other than old primary and new desired primary
#   to 0
# - Turn off election handoff
# - Use stepdown & stepup commands (even when we don't care which server becomes
#   the new primary
# - Put step up command in retry loop

  # Election timeout specifies how long nodes in a cluster wait to vote/ask

  # at the 1 second setting, because the tests are run against a local
  # deployment which shouldn't have any elections in it at all, unless we are
  # testing step down behavior in which case we want the election timeout
