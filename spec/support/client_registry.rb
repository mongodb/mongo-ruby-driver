# Test suite uses a number of global clients (with lifetimes spanning
# several tests) as well as local clients (created for a single example
# or shared across several examples in one example group).
#
# To make client cleanup easy, all local clients are automatically closed
# after every example. This means there is no need for an individual example
# to worry about closing its local clients.
#
# In SDAM tests, having global clients is problematic because mocks can
# be executed on global clients instead of the local clients.
# To address this, tests can close all global clients. This kills monitoring
# threads and SDAM on the global clients. Later tests that need one of the
# global clients will have the respective global client reconnected
# automatically by the client registry.
#
# Lastly, Client#with sometimes creates a new cluster and sometimes reuses
# the cluster on the receiver. Client registry patches Mongo::Client to
# track all clients returned by Client#with, and considers these clients
# local to the example being run. This means global clients should not be
# created via #with. Being local clients, clients created by #with will be
# automatically closed after each example. If these clients shared their
# cluster with a global client, this will make the global client not do
# SDAM anymore; this situation is automatically fixed by the client registry
# when a subsequent test requests the global client in question.
