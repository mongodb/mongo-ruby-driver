# The tests run against a MongoDB cluster which is
# configured and started externally to the test suite. This allows
# running the entire test suite against, for example, a standalone
# mongod as well as a replica set. The flip side to this is the
# test suite will not work without a running mongo cluster, and
# tests which are not applicable to or cannot be performed on the
# running mongo cluster are skipped.
#
# Not only does the test suite require an externally launched cluster,
# the test suite must also be told how the cluster is configured
# via RS_ENABLED and SHARDED_ENABLED environment variables.
#
# The test suite seems to have issues connecting to a replica set
# via IP addresses if the replica set hosts are defined with hostnames
# (i.e., 127.0.0.1 vs localhost). Try to exactly match the contents of
# MONGODB_URI and `rs.isMaster()` output, either by adjusting MONGODB_URI
# or by reconfiguring the replica set.
#
# In order to run spec tests, the mongo cluster needs to have failpoints
# enabled. This is accomplished by starting mongod with the following option:
#   --setParameter enableTestCommands=1
#
# Use the following environment variables to configure the tests:
#
# CLIENT_DEBUG: Show debug messages from the client.
#   CLIENT_DEBUG=1
#
# MONGODB_URI: Connection string to use instead of 127.0.0.1:27017.
# Specify RS_ENABLED or SHARDED_ENABLED if connecting to a replica set
# or a sharded cluster, otherwise the test suite will establish a
# direct connection to the first host in the URI.
#   MONGODB_URI=127.0.0.1:27001,127.0.0.1:27002
#
# RS_ENALBED: Instruct the test suite to connect to the replica set.
# Set MONGODB_URI appropriately as well.
#   RS_ENABLED=1
#
# SHARDED_ENABLED: Instruct the test suite to connect to the sharded cluster.
# Set MONGODB_URI appropriately as well.
#   SHARDED_ENABLED=1
