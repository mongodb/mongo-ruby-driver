# The tests run against a MongoDB cluster which is
# configured and started externally to the test suite. This allows
# running the entire test suite against, for example, a standalone
# mongod as well as a replica set. The flip side to this is the
# test suite will not work without a running mongo cluster, and
# tests which are not applicable to or cannot be performed on the
# running mongo cluster are skipped.
#
# Not only does the test suite require an externally launched cluster,
# the test suite must also be told how the cluster is configured
# via MONGODB_URI, TOPOLOGY, MONGODB_ADDRESSES, RS_ENABLED, RS_NAME and
# SHARDED_ENABLED environment variables.
#
# The test suite does not validate that it is able to successfully connect
# to the cluster prior to running the tests. If a connection fails entirely,
# the clue is generally failures to invoke methods on nil.
# However, it is also possible to establish a connection to a cluster which
# is not quite correctly configured. The result is usually a mass of test
# failures that are indistinguishable from legitimate failures.
#
# Additionally some of the tests assume that the seed list (given in
# MONGODB_URI or MONGODB_ADDRESSES) encompasses all servers in the cluster,
# and will fail when MONGODB_URI includes only one host of a replica set.
# It is best to include all hosts of the cluster in MONGODB_URI and
# MONGODB_ADDRESSES.
#
# The test suite seems to have issues connecting to a replica set
# via IP addresses if the replica set hosts are defined with hostnames
# (i.e., 127.0.0.1 vs localhost). Try to exactly match the contents of
# MONGODB_URI and `rs.isMaster()` output, either by adjusting MONGODB_URI
# or by reconfiguring the replica set.
#
# In order to run spec tests, the mongo cluster needs to have fail points
# enabled. This is accomplished by starting mongod with the following option:
#   --setParameter enableTestCommands=1
#
# Use the following environment variables to configure the tests:
#
# CLIENT_DEBUG: Show debug messages from the client.
#   CLIENT_DEBUG=1
#
# MONGODB_URI: Connection string to use. This must be a valid MongoDB URI;
# mongodb:// and mongodb+srv:// are both supported.
# RS_ENABLED and SHARDED_ENABLED are NOT honored if using MONGODB_URI -
# specify replica set name in the URI and to specify a sharded topology
# set TOPOLOGY=sharded_cluster environment variable.
#   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27001/?replicaSet=test
#   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27001,127.0.0.1:27002/ TOPOLOGY=sharded_cluster
#
# MONGODB_ADDRESSES: Specify addresses to connect to. Use RS_ENABLED,
# RS_NAME and SHARDED_ENABLED to configure the topology.
#   MONGODB_ADDRESSES=127.0.0.1:27017,127.0.0.1:27018
#   MONGODB_ADDRESSES=127.0.0.1:27017,127.0.0.1:27018 RS_ENABLED=1
#   MONGODB_ADDRESSES=127.0.0.1:27017,127.0.0.1:27018 RS_ENABLED=1 RS_NAME=test
#   MONGODB_ADDRESSES=127.0.0.1:27017,127.0.0.1:27018 SHARDED_ENABLED=1
#
# RS_ENABLED: Instruct the test suite to connect to a replica set.
# RS_ENABLED is only honored when not using MONGODB_URI; to connect to a
# replica set with MONGODB_URI, specify the replica set name in the URI
# (despite the Ruby driver performing topology discovery by default, it
# doesn't do so in the test suite).
# RS_NAME can be given to specify the replica set name; the default is
# ruby-driver-rs.
#   RS_ENABLED=1
#   RS_ENABLED=1 RS_NAME=test
#
# SHARDED_ENABLED: Instruct the test suite to connect to the sharded cluster.
# Set MONGODB_URI appropriately as well.
#   SHARDED_ENABLED=1
#
# SSL_ENABLED: Instruct the test suite to connect to the cluster via SSL.
#   SSL_ENABLED=1
#   # Also acceptable:
#   SSL=ssl
#
# Note: SSL can also be enabled by giving ssl=true in the MONGODB_URI options.
