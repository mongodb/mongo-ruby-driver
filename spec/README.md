# Running Ruby Driver Tests

## Quick Start

To run the test suite against a local MongoDB deployment listening on port
27017, run:

    rake

When run without options, the test suite will automatically detect deployment
topology and configure itself appropriately. Standalone, replica set and
sharded cluster topologies are supported (though the test suite will presently
use only the first listed shard in a sharded cluster if given a seed list,
or the one running on port 27017 if not given a seed list).

TLS, authentication and other options can be configured via URI options by
setting `MONGODB_URI` environment variable appropriately. Examples of such
configuration are given later in this document.

## MongoDB Server Deployment

The tests require a running MongoDB deployment, configured and started
externally to the test suite. Tests that are not appropriate for the running
deployment will be skipped.

## Starting MongoDB Deployment

There are many ways in which MongoDB can be started. The instructions below
are for manually launching `mongod` instances and using
[mlaunch](http://blog.rueckstiess.com/mtools/mlaunch.html)
(part of [mtools](https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools)) for more complex
deployments, but other tools like
[mongodb-runner](https://github.com/mongodb-js/runner) and
[Mongo Orchestration](https://github.com/10gen/mongo-orchestration) can
in principle also work.

### Standalone

The simplest possible deployment is a standalone `mongod`, which can be
launched as follows:

    # Launch mongod in one terminal
    mkdir /tmp/mdb
    mongod --dbpath /tmp/mdb
    
    # Run tests in another terminal
    rake

A standalone deployment is a good starting point, however a great many tests
require a replica set deployment and will be skipped on a standalone deployment.

### Replica Set

While a replica set can be started and configured by hand, doing so is
cumbersome. The examples below use
[mlaunch](http://blog.rueckstiess.com/mtools/mlaunch.html)
to start a replica set.

First, install [mtools](https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools):

    pip install mtools --user
    export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
    
Then, launch a replica set:

    mlaunch init --replicaset --name ruby-driver-rs \
      --dir /tmp/mdb-rs --setParameter enableTestCommands=1

The test suite willl automatically detect the topology, no explicit
configuration is needed:

    rake

### Sharded Cluster

A sharded cluster can be configured with mlaunch:

    mlaunch init --replicaset --name ruby-driver-rs --sharded 1 \
      --dir /tmp/mdb-sc --setParameter enableTestCommands=1

As with the replica set, the test suite will automatically detect sharded
cluster topology.

## TLS With Verification

The test suite includes a set of TLS certificates for configuring a server
and a client to perform full TLS verification. The server can be started as
follows, if the current directory is the top of the driver source tree:

    mlaunch init --single --dir /tmp/mdb-ssl --sslMode requireSSL \
      --sslPEMKeyFile `pwd`/spec/support/certificates/server.pem \
      --sslCAFile `pwd`/spec/support/certificates/ca.pem \
      --sslClientCertificate `pwd`/spec/support/certificates/client.pem

## TLS Without Verification

It is also possible to enable TLS but omit certificate verification. In this
case a standalone server can be started as follows:

    mlaunch init --single --dir /tmp/mdb-ssl --sslMode requireSSL \
      --sslPEMKeyFile `pwd`/spec/support/certificates/server.pem \
      --sslCAFile `pwd`/spec/support/certificates/ca.pem \
      --sslAllowConnectionsWithoutCertificates \
      --sslAllowInvalidCertificates

To run the test suite against such a server, also omitting certificate
verification, run:

    MONGODB_URI='mongodb://localhost:27017/?tls=true&tlsInsecure=true' rake 

## Authentication

mlaunch can configure authentication on the server:

    mlaunch init --single --dir /tmp/mdb-auth --auth --username dev --password dev

To run the test suite against such a server, run:

    MONGODB_URI='mongodb://dev:dev@localhost:27017/' rake 

## Compression

To be written.

## Other Options

Generally, all URI options recognized by the driver may be set for a test run,
and will cause the clients created by the test suite to have those options
by default. For example, retryable writes may be turned on and off as follows:

    MONGODB_URI='mongodb://localhost:27017/?retryWrites=true' rake 

    MONGODB_URI='mongodb://localhost:27017/?retryWrites=false' rake 

Individual tests may override options that the test suite uses as defaults.
For example, retryable writes tests may create clients with the retry writes
option set to true or false as needed regardless of what the default is for
the entire test run.

It is also possible to, for example, reference non-default hosts and replica
set names:

    MONGODB_URI='mongodb://test.host:27017,test.host:27018/?replicaSet=fooset' rake 

However, as noted in the caveats section, changing the database name used by
the test suite is not supported.

Some tests require internet connectivity, for example to test DNS seed lists
and SRV URIs. These tests can be skipped by setting the following environment
variable:

    EXTERNAL_DISABLED=true

## Caveats

### Socket Permission Errors

If you get permission errors connecting to `mongod`'s socket, adjust its
permissions:

    sudo chmod 0666 /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock

### Non-Identical Hostnames

The test suite should be configured to connect to exactly the hostnames
configured in the cluster. If, for example, the test suite is configured
to use IP addresses but the cluster is configured with hostnames, most tests
would still work (by using SDAM to discover correct cluster configuration)
but will spend a significant amount of extra time on server discovery.

Some tests perform address assertions and will fail if hostnames configured
in the test suite do not match hostnames configured in the cluster.
For the same reason, each node in server configuration should have its port
specified.

### Database Name

The test suite currently does not allow changing the database name that it
uses, which is `ruby-driver`. Attempts to specify a different database name
in the URI for example will lead to some of the tests failing.

### Fail Points

In order to run some of the tests, the mongo cluster needs to have fail points
enabled. This is accomplished by starting `mongod` with the following option:

    --setParameter enableTestCommands=1

### Log Output

The test suite is run with the driver log level set to WARN by default.
This produces a fair amount of output as many tests trigger various conditions
resulting in the driver outputting warnings. This is expected behavior.

## Running Individual Examples

Individual examples can be run by invoking `rspec` instead of `rake`. Prior
to running `rspec`, ensure the test suite created users for itself - this
is done by the `rake` command automatically, or you can manually invoke the
Rake task which configures the deployment for testing:

    rake spec:prepare

Then, any of the standard RSpec invocations will work:

    rspec path/to/file_spec.rb

## Configuration Reporting

To have the test suite report its current configuration, run:

    rake spec:config
