description: "Discovered single mongos"

# Ruby driver performs topology discovery by default.
# This test verifies that a URI with just a server address results in
# the sharded topology if the server replies that it is a mongos.
# As part of https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SPEC-1248 this test can be
# adjusted to use directConnection=false option, at which point it will
# apply to all drivers.
